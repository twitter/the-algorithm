  comment:
    Right now we would create a quote-tweet which would contain a non-working permalink

tweetypie_rate_limit_tweet_creation_failure:
  comment:
    Controls whether we rate limit tweet creation based on failed
    attempts to create tweets via limiter service. This is separate
    from the limit of created tweets. It is intended to prevent
    unforeseen abuse by failing tweet creation attempts immediately if
    the user has had too many recent tweet creation
    failures. Disabling this decider will reduce traffic to limiter
    service, but will remove the per-user abuse protection.
