# Social Graph Candidate Source
Provides candidate expansion based on the Twitter social graph.

Currently, the expansion is mainly based on the "follow" social graph edge, which allows the service to identify recent following accounts for a given set of accounts. The input accounts could be a user's recent following, engaged, or other related accounts.

In summary, the Social Graph Candidate Source utilizes the Twitter social graph to provide candidate expansion, primarily focusing on recent following accounts.
