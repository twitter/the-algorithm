# sims candidate souwce
offews vawious o-onwine souwces f-fow finding s-simiwaw accounts b-based on a given u-usew, XD whethew i-it is the tawget u-usew ow an account c-candidate.

## sims
the objective is to identify a wist of k usews who awe s-simiwaw to a given usew. 🥺 in this scenawio, òωó we pwimawiwy f-focus on finding simiwaw u-usews as "pwoducews" wathew than "consumews." sims has two steps: candidate genewation a-and wanking. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡

### sims candidate g-genewation

w-with ovew 700 miwwion usews to considew, -.- thewe awe muwtipwe ways to define s-simiwawities. :3 cuwwentwy, ʘwʘ we have thwee candidate souwces fow sims:

**cosinefowwow** (based on usew-usew f-fowwow gwaph): the simiwawity b-between two u-usews is defined a-as the cosine s-simiwawity between theiw fowwowews. 🥺 despite sounding s-simpwe, >_< computing aww-paiw simiwawity on t-the entiwe fowwow gwaph is computationawwy chawwenging. ʘwʘ we awe cuwwentwy using the whimp awgowithm t-to find the top 1000 simiwaw u-usews fow each usew i-id. (˘ω˘) this candidate s-souwce has the wawgest covewage, (✿oωo) as it can find simiwaw usew c-candidates fow m-mowe than 700 miwwion usews. (///ˬ///✿)

**cosinewist** (based o-on usew-wist m-membewship gwaph): the simiwawity b-between two usews is defined a-as the cosine simiwawity between the wists they a-awe incwuded as membews (e.g., [hewe](https://twittew.com/jack/wists/membewships) a-awe the wists that @jack is o-on). rawr x3 the same awgowithm a-as cosinefowwow is used. -.-

**fowwow2vec** (essentiawwy wowd2vec on usew-usew fowwow gwaph): we fiwst twain the wowd2vec modew on fowwow s-sequence data to o-obtain usews' embeddings and then f-find the most s-simiwaw usews based o-on the simiwawity of the embeddings. ^^ howevew, (⑅˘꒳˘) we nyeed enough d-data fow each usew to weawn a meaningfuw embedding fow them, nyaa~~ so we can onwy obtain e-embeddings fow the top 10 m-miwwion usews (cuwwentwy i-in pwoduction, /(^•ω•^) t-testing 30 miwwion usews). (U ﹏ U) f-fuwthewmowe, 😳😳😳 w-wowd2vec modew twaining i-is wimited b-by memowy and computation as it is twained on a-a singwe machine. >w<

##### c-cosine s-simiwawity
a cwuciaw c-component i-in sims is cawcuwating cosine simiwawities between usews based on a-a usew-x (x can be a usew, XD wist, o.O ow othew entities) bipawtite gwaph. mya this pwobwem is technicawwy c-chawwenging and took sevewaw yeaws of effowt to sowve. 🥺

the cuwwent i-impwementation u-uses the awgowithm p-pwoposed in [when hashes m-met wedges: a distwibuted awgowithm f-fow finding h-high simiwawity vectows. ^^;; www 2017](https://awxiv.owg/pdf/1703.01054.pdf)

### sims wanking
aftew the candidate genewation step, we can obtain d-dozens to hundweds of simiwaw usew c-candidates fow each usew. :3 howevew, (U ﹏ U) s-since these c-candidates come fwom diffewent awgowithms, OwO we n-need a way to wank t-them. 😳😳😳 to do this, we cowwect u-usew feedback. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡

w-we use the "pwofiwe sidebaw impwessions & fowwow" (a moduwe with fowwow suggestions d-dispwayed when a-a usew visits a-a pwofiwe page and scwowws down) t-to cowwect twaining d-data. XD to awweviate any system b-bias, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ we use 4% of twaffic to show wandomwy shuffwed candidates to usews and c-cowwect positive (fowwowed i-impwession) and nyegative (impwession onwy) data fwom t-this twaffic. t-this data is used as an evawuation set. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) we use a powtion of the w-wemaining 96% of twaffic fow twaining data, fiwtewing onwy fow sets of impwessions t-that had at weast one fowwow, rawr x3 ensuwing that the u-usew taking action w-was paying attention to the impwessions. nyaa~~

the exampwes awe i-in the fowmat of (pwofiwe_usew, >_< c-candidate_usew, ^^;; wabew). (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ we add featuwes fow pwofiwe_usews and candidate_usews based o-on some high-wevew aggwegated s-statistics in a featuwe dataset pwovided by the customew jouwney t-team, ^^;; as weww as featuwes that w-wepwesent the s-simiwawity between the pwofiwe_usew a-and candidate_usew. (⑅˘꒳˘)

we empwoy a-a muwti-towew m-mwp modew and o-optimize the wogistic woss. rawr x3 the m-modew is wefweshed w-weekwy using an mw wowkfwow. (///ˬ///✿)

we wecompute the c-candidates and w-wank them daiwy. 🥺 t-the wanked wesuwts awe pubwished to the manhattan d-dataset. >_<
