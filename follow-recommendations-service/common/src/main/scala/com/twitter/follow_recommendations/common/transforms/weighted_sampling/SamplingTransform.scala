  Description: This function takes in a set of candidate users and ranks them for a who-to-follow
  request by sampling from the Placket-Luce distribution
  (https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/PlackettLuce/vignettes/Overview.html) with a three
  variations. The first variation is that the scores of the candidates are multiplied by
  multiplicativeFactor before sampling. The second variation is that the scores are
  exponentiated before sampling. The third variation is that depending on how many who-to-follow
  positions are being requested, the first k positions are reserved for the candidates with the
  highest scores (and they are sorted in decreasing order of score) and the remaining positions
  are sampled from a Placket-Luce. We use the efficient algorithm proposed in this blog
  https://medium.com/swlh/going-old-school-designing-algorithms-for-fast-weighted-sampling-in-production-c48fc1f40051
  to sample from a Plackett-Luce. Because of numerical stability reasons, before sampling from this
  distribution, (1) we subtract off the maximum score from all the scores and (2) if after
  this subtraction and multiplication by the multiplicative factor the resulting score is <= -10,
  we force the candidate's transformed score under the above algorithm to be 0 (so r^(1/w) = 0)
  where r is a random number and w is the transformed score.

  inputs:
  - target: HasClientContext (WTF request)
  - candidates: sequence of CandidateUsers (users that need to be ranked from a who-to-follow
                request) each of which has a score

  inputs accessed through feature switches, i.e. through target.params (see the following file:
  "follow-recommendations-service/common/src/main/scala/com/ExTwitter/follow_recommendations/common/
  transforms/weighted_sampling/SamplingTransformParams.scala"):
  - topKFixed: the first k positions of the who-to-follow ranking correspond to the users with the k
               highest scores and are not sampled from the Placket-Luce distribution
  - multiplicativeFactor: multiplicativeFactor is used to transform the scores of each candidate by
                          multiplying that user's score by multiplicativeFactor

  output:
  - Sequence of CandidateUser whose order represents the ranking of users in a who-to-follow request
    This ranking is sampled from a Placket-Luce distribution.
