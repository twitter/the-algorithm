Provides accounts based on PPMI ([Positive Pointwise Mutual Information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointwise_mutual_information#Positive_PMI)) using follow actions as a feature for a specific local (language + country) within a week. In simpler terms, it provides a list of the most followed accounts for a given country and language input, based on the PPMI algorithm.

PPMI is a statistical measure of the association between two events. In this case, it measures the association between the follow actions and the accounts being followed.

In summary, the service utilizes PPMI and follow actions to provide a list of the most followed accounts for a specific country and language input.
