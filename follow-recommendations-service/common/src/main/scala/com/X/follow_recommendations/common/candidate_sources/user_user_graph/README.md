# User-User Graph Candidate Source

## User-User Graph (UUG)
The UUG algorithm reads User-Follow-User engagements that occurred in the past 24-48 hours, and provides accounts that the given user's recent followings have recently followed themselves. The UUG algorithm is implemented using the real-time graph processing library GraphJet.
