  Scenario: Run a single-fandom exchange

  Given basic tags
    And I am logged in as "mod1"
    And I have a canonical "Celebrities & Real People" fandom tag named "Hockey RPF"
    And I have a canonical "Celebrities & Real People" fandom tag named "Bandom"
    And a canonical character "Alexander Ovechkin" in fandom "Hockey RPF"
    And a canonical character "Gerard Way" in fandom "Bandom"
    And I set up the tag set "HockeyExchangeTags" with the fandom tags "Hockey RPF"
  When I go to the "HockeyExchangeTags" tag set page
  Then I should see "About HockeyExchangeTags"
    And I should see "Celebrities & Real People" within ".index"
  When I follow "â†“" within ".index"
  Then I should see "Hockey RPF"
  When I have set up the gift exchange "My Hockey Exchange"
    And I fill in single-fandom gift exchange challenge options
    And I fill in "Tag Sets To Use:" with "HockeyExchangeTags"
    And I submit
  Then I should see "Challenge was successfully created"
  When I follow "Challenge Settings"
  Then I should see "HockeyExchangeTags"
  When I follow "Sign-up Form"
    And I check the 1st checkbox with the value "Hockey RPF"
    And I check the 2nd checkbox with the value "Hockey RPF"
    And I enter "Gerard Way" in the "Characters" autocomplete field
  Then I should see "No suggestions found" in the autocomplete
  # "Gerard Way" from a different fandom cannot appear in autocomplete; let's force it anyway.
  When I fill in the 1st field with id matching "character_tagnames" with "Gerard Way"
    And I submit
  Then I should see "Sorry! We couldn't save this challenge signup because"
    And I should see "These character tags in your request are not in the selected fandom(s), Hockey RPF: Gerard Way (Your moderator may be able to fix this.)"
    And I should not see "Sign-up was successfully created."
  When I follow "remove Gerard Way"
    And I choose "Alexander Ovechkin" from the "Characters" autocomplete
    And I submit
  Then I should see "Sign-up was successfully created."
