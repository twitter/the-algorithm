      <p><h2><a name="basics"></a><strong>The Basics </strong></p></h2>

      <p><a name="1"></a><strong>What is While We Tell of Yuletide 
        Treasure/Yuletide/The Obscure Fandom Fiction Exchange Project? </strong></p>

      <p>Yuletide is a gen, het, and slash multifandom secret fiction exchange for obscure or rarely 
      written fandoms. Begun in 2003 by astolat and tzikeh, it was inspired by <a href="http://www.juppy.org/santa/">don 
        we now our gay apparel</a> (the popslash secret santa project).

      <p>Each participant signs up in advance, choosing the fandoms she's willing to write and the fandoms she 
      would be most happy to receive from a very large list of options. After signups, assignments go out; each participant must write one 
      1,000-word (minimum) story, and each will receive one 1,000-word (minimum) story in return. All stories are due by mid-December. 
      On December 25, the stories go live with no author names attached; on January 1, the 
      author names go live.

      <p>If you're new to Yuletide and would like a more expanded overview of the basics, 
      <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide/216928.html">go here</a>!

      <p><b>Note: by signing up for Yuletide and uploading a story, you are agreeing to let us keep that story 
      in the archive, for good.</b> We will not delete it at a later date <a href=#45>even at your request</a>. 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#basics">Basics</a>

      <p><a name="2"></a><strong>Who runs the project?</strong> 
       <p>elynross currently runs the more visible aspects of the challenge, and astolat coordinates the
        fancy scripting necessary to accomplish the matching, with geeklite assisting as needed. Collectively,
        the current team can be reached at <a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a>. 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#basics">Basics</a>

      <p><a name="3"></a><strong>Who can participate? </strong> 

        <p>
        1) <b>NOTE: You must be at least 18 to participate in the Yuletide Challenge.</b> 

      <br>
      <br>
        2) For Yuletide 2009, there is a general amnesty for anyone who previously defaulted or was banned! The record of your default/ban is maintained,
      however, and if you default again in 2009, you may be banned. You can check your <a href="http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/defaulter_check.cgi">default status here</a>.
      <br>
      <br>
       3) If you default in any year without notifying the moderators, or if you default two years in a row,
      then you are banned from further Yuletide participation.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#basics">Basics</a>

      <p><a name="4"></a><strong>Do I have to have a livejournal to participate in Yuletide? </strong> 
      <p>No! However, while the Yuletide challenge itself is website-based, the planning 
      and discussion relating to it takes place on Livejournal, in two LJs. You can read both of these without an LJ account,
      but it may make things easier for you to have one of your own.

      <p>All news and official announcements are posted to the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide_admin">Yuletide_Admin</a> community. 
        Only the moderators may post to the admin community, although anyone may comment on an admin post. 
      <br>
      <br>
        The broader <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide">Yuletide</a> LJ is available for Yuletide participants to post their Yuletide experiences, discussions, and recommendations. Please
      see <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide/profile">the community info</a> for eligible topics. You will not 
      be able to post directly to the Yuletide LJ if you do not have an LJ of your own, although you will be able to make comments 
        to posts made by others. 


      <p>With an LJ, you can join or watch the community and more easily keep track of announcements on your Friends list,
       instead of having to remember to check back regularly. If you don't have an LJ but want to comment on a post to 
      either Yuletide community, please sign your comment. Any anonymous comments will be deleted.

      <p>If you maintain your journal at a non-LJ site, or if you prefer to get your Admin posts through a syndicated
      feed, the Admin LJ is available as both an <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide_admin/data/rss">RSS feed</a>
      and as an <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide_admin/data/atom">Atom feed</a>. 

      <p>Note: If you want to be <a href="#pinch">a pinch hitter</a>, you should join <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yuletide_pinch_hit/">the Yahoogroups list</a>. 
      All pinch-hitting assignments will be sent there.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#basics">Basics</a>

      <p><a name="5"></a><strong>What is the Yuletide schedule? 
        </strong> 
      <p>We start assembling the fandom listings as early as mid-September, but no later than early to mid-October, 
        with a goal of opening sign-ups no later than mid- to late October. Sign-ups remain open for a week, 
      and then assignments go out as soon as the scripts to match 
        authors and recipients can be run and any problems handled. For 2009 The deadline for defaulting with notification and without
      penalty is December 7th. Stories are due December 21st, 9:00 p.m. <a href="http://www.worldtimezone.com/">Eastern Time (ET)</a>. The archive is opened on December 25th, and authors 
        are revealed on January 1st.

      <p><a name="policy"</a><strong>What is Yuletide's policy concerning fandoms where the professional creator/author
      has asked that no fanfiction be written?</strong>

      <p>Yuletide does not prevent these fandoms from being nominated or written. However, if we receive official notice from
      representatives of these creators/authors asking us to remove fanfiction for their works, we will do so. At this
      point, only Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's <i>Saint-Germain</i> series is ineligible for this reason.

        </div>

      <p> <h2><a name="assemble"></a><strong>Assembling the fandoms   </strong> </h2>

      <p>Each year we compile a new list of fandom/character nominations from potential participants, up to six 
      fandoms per person. While we maintain a list of all previously nominated fandoms/characters, this is strictly 
      for inspiration and minimizing work (when you select a previous fandom, it will retain the previously entered
      character lists). For a fandom to be included in the current year, it must be newly nominated by 
      at least one person.

      Nominations will be held for at least one week during the month prior to the opening of signups. The <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/nominations/nominate_fandoms.cgi">Nomination
      Form</a> can be found here, but it is only available during this one-week period. 


      <p><a name="7"></a><strong>What constitutes a rare/obscure/inactive fandom? </strong> 
      <p> The challenge includes only fandoms that are determined to be relatively obscure/inactive. This is 
      decided using an arcane geometry involving but not limited to current fiction-related activity levels in places 
      like LJ, Yahoogroups, and fiction archives, taking into account Google searches, LJ interests, and the 
      recommendations of those who know the fandoms. TV shows that were once very active but went off-air at 
      least ten years ago are eligible for consideration. Brand-new shows that are already active may still be
      eligible for at least a year.

      <p>Some "umbrella" fandoms are currently ineligible, along with related fandoms that may of 
      themselves be relatively rare. Whether a related title is ineligible is at the discretion
      of the moderators. Some umbrella titles are Batman, Doctor Who, Final Fantasy, Law and Order, Mario, 
      Power Rangers, Sailor Moon, Spiderman, Superman, Transformers, X-Men.

      <p>There is no hard and fast rule, and there may well be fandoms available that you don't consider obscure. 
        Please <b>do</b> suggest absolutely anything you think of as truly underrepresented.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assemble">Assembling the fandoms </a>

      <p><a name="8"></a><strong>Who decides whether a fandom is included, or not? </strong> 
      <p>The ultimate decision lies with the moderators, and their decisions, however misguided they may be, are final. 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assemble">Assembling the fandoms </a>

      <p><a name="9"></a><strong>Can I suggest rare/obscure/inactive fandoms 
        even if I don't write/am not going to sign up for Yuletide? </strong> 
      <p>We prefer that suggestions come from those planning to sign up, as this brings the fandoms offered 
      and the fandoms requested closer together. However, each year we have a brainstorming post in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide/">Yuletide 
      community LJ</a> that we encourage anyone to post to, to get the ideas flowing! 


      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assemble">Assembling the fandoms </a>

      <p><a name="tags"></a><strong>How do I nominate a fandom for the challenge? How do I designate the fandom? Do I need to use a qualifier on the name?</strong>

      <p>Nominations will run for at least one week during the month preceding the opening of signups, followed by roughly a week
      of adding of characters/making corrections/merging duplicates/removing duplicates from character lists.

       The <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/nominations/nominate_fandoms.cgi">Yuletide Fandom 
      Nominations</a> form is only open during that period. Through this form you can select a fandom from the <a href="http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/master.shtml">Master
      Fandom List</a> (note: not all fandoms in the Master Fandom List are still eligible, but only the eligible fandoms will
      display in the Nomination form's drop-down menus), or add a new fandom, for up to six fandoms. Please limit
      your nominations to only those fandoms you're seriously considering requesting at Yuletide, to keep the list smaller. This
      will hopefully help keep the fandoms offered and the fandoms requested fairly similar.

      <p>Then you will be able to input characters for a new fandom, or add them to a previously available fandom.


      <p>If you change your mind during the nominations period, or want to nominate additional fandoms/add additional
      characters, you can do
      so by filling out the form again, <b>using exactly the same name and e-mail address</b>. Make sure to fill out 
      the form again completely -- don't just correct your error.  The new nomination form will overwrite the 
      previous one, and any fandom you nominated the first time, but not the second, will be removed from the
      list of currently nominated fandoms -- unless someone else has nominated it. 

      <p>Note: Crossovers are not eligible for nomination for Yuletide, even if both the fandoms are rare, 
      so please do not nominate a fandom such as:

      <ul><li>[RPF - 30 Rock/Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]
      <li>[Brimstone/Reaper]</ul>

      <p>If someone asks for a crossover in their details, then it's up to the author whether they feel they can/want 
      to do that, or not, however.

      <p>Our goal is that each fandom be uniquely identifiable. If your fandom has a unique name, then
      it won't need a qualifier. If it might be confused with a very similar title in another medium or another
      year, or if your fandom draws from multiple
      sources (for example, anime <i>and</i> manga) that aren't distinct enough to warrant separate entries, then you 
      will want to use a qualifier. Common qualifiers in use are: anime, book, comic, game, manga, movie, musical, opera,
      play, tv, [year]. These can be combined, if necessary.  e.g.:

      <ul><li>[Bedazzled (1967)]:  this movie has been remade
      <li>[Blade series (movie)]:  there is a TV series
      <li> [1984 (1984 movie)]:  the title exists in multiple versions, in multiple mediums

      <li> [300 (comic or movie)]:  knowledge of either version is acceptable</ul>

      <p><b>Books are almost always listed as [AuthorFirst AuthorLast - title]</b> (for one or two authors), with one dash, one space before and after. There is no need to 
      use the "book" qualifier with this format. When nominating a series of books, use the common collective name, if
      there is one. If a fandom is found as both a movie and a book, without important variation, it will be listed by the title, with the qualification (book or movie).

      <ul><li>[Daphne du Maurier - Rebecca]
      <li>[Stephen King and Peter Straub - Black House]
      <li>[C S Lewis - Out of the Silent Planet series]
      <li>[Brokeback Mountain (book or movie)]</ul>

      <p>The exception to the [author-title] format is books written by three or more authors, even if they used
      a common pseudonym, in which case the (book) modifier <i>is</i> used, e.g.:


      <ul><li>[The Hardy Boys series (book)]:  qualifier distinguishes it from the Hardy Boys TV show
      <li>[Nancy Drew mysteries]</ul>

      <p>Only books are listed by author. Comics/graphic novels are listed by title, to keep the category
      formatting consistent.

      <p>Music videos and songs should be listed by title, with the (song) or (music video) qualifier.

      <p><b>Mythologies are always listed as: Mythology - [area]</b>, e.g. [Mythology - Irish], [Mythology - Greek and Roman].

      <p><b>Real Person Fiction is always listed as: RPF - [title]</b>, e.g. RPF - [RPF - 16th-17th century]. Please make sure
      that the characters you would like to nominate for RPF fandoms will not fit within an already designated
      RPF fandom. Musical groups can be listed by group ([RPF - Rolling Stones]), but individual artists should
      be placed with their genre ([Country Music], [Alt Pop Rock Solo Artists (Asian/Western)], etc.)

      <p>For fandoms with multiple titles/foreign fandoms, please list only the original language title/the title most commonly 
      used, just as you would with English-language works that have been translated. This is a change in 2009, because the length of some fandom titles was breaking things. 


      <p>If you don't know the date of a movie or TV show, try looking at <a href="http://epguides.com/">epguides.com</a> or  
      the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</a> to find out? <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> and 

      <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> can also be decent sources of information.

      <p>We ask that you please only list characters that you are planning to request, to keep character listings

      <p><a name="11"></a><strong>How do I sign up? </strong> 
      <p>The sign-up form is <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/signup_page1.cgi">here</a> and will open for business 
      in October or early November. Please monitor the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide_admin/">Yuletide Admin LJ</a>
       or check the <a href="http://www.yuletidetreasure.org/index.shtml">Yuletide home page</a> for the specific date, 
      closer to Challenge time. 

      <p>Please read all the instructions carefully! You must fill out every field that 
        is not labeled "Optional" in order for the form to work. 

      <p>Please make sure you're signing up with a unique name. 
        Check the list of those authors who have already registered on the main page 
        to be sure. This will appear on the right side of the page. You also cannot use names that are the same except for spaces/special characters/capitalization -- sorry!


      <p>There's no limit on how many people can request a given fandom, so don't worry if you see that your fandom has been picked already. 
      You can request anything you want. 

      <p>After you hit submit on the form, you will receive an 
        email copy of your selections. Please check this carefully to be sure that you 
        didn't accidentally choose the wrong fandom or characters. If you made a mistake, 
        you can sign up again, <b>using exactly the same name and e-mail address</b>. Make sure to fill out the form 
      again completely -- don't just correct your error.  The new submission form will overwrite the incorrect one. 

      <p>If you do not receive a copy of your confirmation email within 24 hours, please write to 
      <a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a> to make sure there were no
      errors in your email address. If there were, your signup will be deleted, and you'll need to sign up again.

      <p><a name="12"></a><strong>How many fandoms/characters can I request? </strong>  
      <p>Once the sign-up sheet is live, you will be able to request 
        three to four fandoms from a pull-down menu consisting of all requested fandoms, 
        and then choose up to four characters from each fandom. This does not mean the author will be limited to these four characters 
        -- only that these are characters you'd like to see written about.
        You will also see an option for 'Any,' which means that you're asking for a story about any of the characters listed in 
        the pull-down menu. <b>Please note: you must choose at least three different fandoms. Picking one fandom with 
        three different sets of characters won't count towards your minimum of three different fandoms</b> -- although your fourth fandom can
      duplicate one of those three, with a different set of characters. 


      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#signing">Signing up for Yuletide</a>

      <p><a name="13"></a><strong>How do I pick multiple characters? 
        </strong> 
      <p>To select multiple characters, hold down the "control" key on Windows machines or the "command (apple)" key 
        on a Mac <b> while selecting each character</b>. 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#signing">Signing up for Yuletide</a>

      <p><a name="14"></a><strong>What can I put in the additional 
        details field? How specific can I get? </strong> 
      <p>Please remember that the purpose of the While We Tell 
        of Yuletide Treasure challenge is to give you stories you truly want to read, 
        not to play “stump the author.” Make your requests based on what you’d really 
        enjoy, not on how crazy/difficult you think it will be for someone to write. 

       <p> Beyond that, you can be as specific as you'd like in your details, but be aware 
        that your author is only bound by your fandom and character choices, and may 
        approach both fandom and characters differently than you do.  If you prefer het or slash, 
      but enjoy gen as well, it's a good idea to say so in the details, since there's no way to 
      know if your request is going to a het, slash, or gen writer, and that gives everyone a workable option. 

      <p>We encourage you to include comments about the types of stories you like or don't like, or to 
        post a "Dear Yuletide Writer" letter to your LJ/website/in the comments of the post made for
      that purpose in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide">Yuletide LJ</a>, because often 
      authors will look for additional information of this sort. 

      <p>For some ideas on how to write inspiring prompts, you might look at 
      <a href="http://thefourthvine.livejournal.com/79251.html?style=mine">this post</a> and 
      <a href="http://liviapenn.livejournal.com/477788.html?style=mine">this one</a>, both excellent
      resources.

      <p>Your author may do their best to accommodate your more specific requests, but they are not 
      bound by them. We hope that all concerned will be generous and gracious in their interactions. 
      As with the writing half of the challenge, the more flexible you can be as a reader within the 
      boundaries of what you like, the more enjoyment you're likely to get out of the process. 

      <p>One thing to keep in mind when you add your details is 
        that these requests go public for the <a href="#nyr">New Year's Resolution</a> (NYR) 
      challenge after Yuletide is over, and you may want to tailor your requests with that in mind. It's also a good idea 
        not to say "see above/ditto" if you have the same general parameters for your fandoms, 
        since the NYR requests are broken out by fandom, not recipient. Put your details 
        in for each fandom. 


      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#signing">Signing up for Yuletide</a>

      <p><a name="15"></a><strong>How many fandoms do I have to offer to write? </strong> 
      <p>You <b>must</b> offer at least three different fandoms (one fandom with three different 
      relationships doesn't count as three unique fandoms). Beyond that you may select as many fandoms as you want; the more fandoms you 
      offer, the easier it is for the script to make matches. 
      <p>That said, please be sure you're genuinely willing to write any of the fandoms you offer -- you have as much 
      chance of being asked to write the one you're least comfortable with as the one you're most comfortable with! 
      And you may only have a single match on your recipient's list; you may not even be familiar with her other two 
      or three options.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#signing">Signing up for Yuletide</a>

      <p><a name="16"></a><strong>How many characters can I offer to write?</strong>
      <p>For each fandom you select, you can specify up to four characters, or you can choose 'Any' to indicate that 
      you're willing to write any available characters. If you want to write more than four characters but fewer than 
      "Any" for a single fandom, or you're only willing to write/don't want to write certain combinations, you can sign 
      up multiple times for the same fandom, specifying only combinations you're willing to write together. There is no
      limit to the number of times you can sign up for the same fandom, with different character combinations.

      <p>For example, if I select the Bob Newhart Show, and I am willing to write Carlin, or Peterson, but not Carlin
      and Peterson in the same story, I could choose something like this:

      <ul><li>Bob Newhart Show: Bob/Emily/Carol/Carlin
      <li>Bob Newhart Show: Bob/Emily/Carol/Peterson</ul>

      <p>(slashes here work like commas, so these could be gen, het, or slash, depending on the request). 

      <p>These would match to anyone requesting any combination of the characters named in a single listing (eg, any one, any two, any three, or all four), but not 
      someone requesting Carlin <i>and</i> Peterson. 

      <p>If you choose "Any," you may be matched to any requests for that fandom with any combination of characters. <b>Please do not choose 'Any' 
      unless you're genuinely comfortable writing <i>anyone</i> or any combination of two to four characters in the 
      character list for that fandom</b>. 'Any' does <b>not</b> mean that you'll get to pick which characters go into the 
      story, unless your recipient also chooses 'Any'; it means you are willing to write any characters your recipient has 
      requested, in any combination of one to four characters. 


      <p>What it boils down to is this: please don't participate unless you are willing to be flexible, both as a reader 
      and a writer. And if you're assigned something that makes you blink and wonder, remember, that's the "challenge" part
      of the Yuletide challenge!

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#signing">Signing up for Yuletide</a>

      <p><a name="17"></a><strong>I already signed up, but I saw another fandom that I'd 
        rather write/request. Can I change my submission before the deadline?</strong> 

      <p>Absolutely. To do this, just fill out the <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/signup_page1.cgi">signup form</a> again,
       but <b>please make sure you use the exact same name and e-mail address </b> so we can tell it's a duplicate, and so the 
      automatic-updater doesn't add you to the participants list under two names.  
      You must fill out the form completely, including the fandoms you're keeping the same -- the new form will overwrite your original signup form. 
      Please keep your confirmation emails so that you have the exact information under which you signed up in case 
        of any confusion.  


      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#signing">Signing up for Yuletide</a>

      <p><a name="18"></a><strong>Can I talk about what I offered to write?</strong>

      write anywhere (including LJs, blogs, chat, etc. This includes posting lists of fandoms you offered). This is a secret challenge, and we don't want to give people hints as

      <p><a name="22"></a><strong>When is the deadline for uploading

      than that, you can upload it at any time after you receive your assignment. Note: In 2009, the window for uploading will
      begin later than usual. 

      <p>In fact, if you finish earlier, we would be delighted if you uploaded before the deadline. The challenge gets bigger every year, which 
      means the load on the server on the final day is bigger every year. This leads to server crashes and participant panic and the possible loss 
      of stories, and really, you don't want to be part of that.

      <p> <h2><a name="pinch"></a><strong>Pinch Hitting</strong></h2> 


      <p><a name="24"></a><strong>What is "pinch hitting"? Do I have to be a Yuletide participant? How do I volunteer?</strong> 
      <p>Every year, for various reasons, some people don't complete their assignments. If we 
      receive notice that someone will have to default, we find someone to "pinch hit," or write a substitute 
      story. This author may or may not be a regular Yuletide participant, but they're held to the same 
      requirements as the original author, unless it's a last-minute pinch hit to cover someone who has no 
      story as of December 25th.

      <p>You do not have to be a Yuletide participant to be a pinch hitter! Many people prefer to pinch 
      hit, rather than sign up for Yuletide, because it gives them the opportunity to see the fandom requests and
      prompts before deciding to volunteer.

      <p>If you want to volunteer, please sign up for the <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yuletide_pinch_hit">Yuletide Pinch Hitters' List</a>! 
      When a pinch hit is required, a note will go out on the list containing all the requests for that participant. The first person to respond 
      is assigned the pinch hit.
      <ul>
      <li>Pinch hits that are assigned before December 10th have the regular deadline of December 21st. 

      <li>Pinch hits that go out after December 10th should be uploaded by December 23rd.
      <li>Any pinch hits that turn up after the deadline of December 21st may have until December 24th, but we ask that they
      be uploaded as soon as possible.</ul>

      <p>Note: On the 23rd-24th of December, we start <a href="#madness"> Yuletide Madness</a>, where we post
      the requests of those who do not yet have a story uploaded, even if they have an assigned pinch hitter who
      hasn't uploaded yet. This does not mean we don't trust those pinch hitters, nor do we want
      to undercut the response to their stories. We simply want to guarantee that everyone has a story when the
      archive opens. If you are not comfortable with the possibility that your story may be one of multiple
      stories your recipient receives, you might want to reconsider pinch hitting on a late request. 

      <p>Even with Yuletide Madness, we depend on our pinch hitters to finish their stories, to ensure that the recipients receive a story that
      meets the 1,000+ word limit. After December 24th, the Yuletide Madness stories aren't held to
      the same word limit, as they are written on such extreme short notice. However, we have had pinch hitters default in the past, so this is our safety net.

      <p>Please take your assignment seriously! Please do not talk

        elsewhere. You can express disbelief at your own gall and perhaps foolishness ("Oh my

        fandom or characters, and <i>please do not complain about your assignment in 
        public</i>. Your recipient may read your LJ or blog, or may seek it out after 
        authors are revealed, and it can be a slap in the face to trip across something 
        like that. Even if you complain in the comments to someone else's post, or on 
        a list, it can get back to the recipient. Beyond that, other participants in 
        Yuletide (including the moderators) may well see it, and it will not reflect 
        well upon you. 

      <p><a name="25"></a><strong>I can't get into the archive/upload my NYR! What happened? </strong> 

      <p>The archive <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/cgi-bin/search.cgi">search engine</a> is closed as soon as signups open for the current year's 
      challenge. The <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/archive/quicksearch.html">Quicksearch</a> remains available until signups close and uploading becomes available again,
      to preserve author anonymity as participants begin writing and uploading new Yuletide stories. Direct links to existing
      stories will still work, however. 


      <p>Opening signups generates new participant and fandom lists, overwriting the old lists used for the previous 
      year, and closing that year's NYR challenge. 

      <p>All stories again become available when the archive reopens
      on December 25th, and NYR uploads for the current year's challenge are possible after January 1st.

        </strong> 
      <p>Sorry, but that's just not possible, unless you were somehow assigned a fandom for which you didn't volunteer. We're working with literally 
        hundreds of participants, and we couldn't reassign one person without shuffling 
        around dozens of others.  Everyone is paired with someone else who listed at least one request 
      that matched something they offered to write. That's the best we can do.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="28"></a><strong>I don't recognize any of the fandoms on my recipient's list. </strong> 
      <p>It's very unlikely that the matching program assigned you something you didn't sign up for, but stranger
      things have happened! If you get something you don't think you signed up for, email us privately 
      at <a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a> as soon as possible. 
      It's possible that there was a glitch in the program, or that you accidentally chose a fandom 
        you did not intend to choose. We will do our best to straighten it out. However, if you do know
      any of the requested fandoms, we would appreciate it if you'd try and fulfill the assignment anyway.

      <p>Note: if we have to assign you a new recipient, it probably means that you'll be writing
      for someone who already has an assigned writer. This is not unheard of, as the matching process always
      has a few stray authors that we have to double-assign, as well as recipients that have to immediately
      go out for a pinch hit, because it's very unlikely that everyone will make requests and offers that
      match up exactly, with nothing left over.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>


      <p><a name="29"></a><strong> Can I find out more about my recipient's request/tastes/opinions? </strong> 
      <p>We ask that you not contact your recipient directly, even in an anonymous LJ comment!

      <p> If you need clarification, or more information, please email us at 
      <a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a>, 
        and we will act as go-between for your questions. This will preserve not only your anonymity, 
      but conceal any indication of which request you're planning to write, as we will make up questions for
      each of the requested fandoms to disguise your <i>real</i> intent. 

      <p>Previous writers have also 
        poked around their recipients' LJs/blogs/websites to see what kinds of things 
        they seem to like, so feel free to do so (and leave some notes in your own LJ/blog, 
        if you have one, for your writer!). 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="30"></a><strong> Do I have to write the 
        specific characters/relationships/situations they ask for? </strong> 
      <p>Remember, somewhere out there, someone is asking the very 
        same questions about <i>your</i> Yuletide request. Please treat their wishes 
        as seriously as you'd like someone else to treat yours. 

      <p>That said, the minimum requirements for a story are:
      <ul>
      <li> It must be 1,000 words in one of the fandoms on your recipient's list.
      <li> It must use all of the characters they specify, unless their details say otherwise.</ul>

      <p> However, you are not limited to <i>only</i> the characters they specify, nor do you have
      to include every character on the fandom's character listing, if they choose 'Any.' 

        <p>It is not mandatory that you follow your recipient's optional details; whether they
      want a particular relationship slashed, name an additional character, ask for a crossover, or spell out 
      what they want in excruciating detail, you are not required to do as they ask. Think of the details
      as prompts, fodder for inspiration. If you can incorporate the details into a story, great! If you're not sure, 
      heck, give it a try (it is a challenge, after all!).  <b>However, if you don't feel that you can 
      accommodate their specific requests, that's fine, too.</b> 


      <p>If your recipient selected 'Any' from the character listing for that fandom, then you can write 
      whichever character(s) you want, and even include characters specifically not listed. Even if their details say "I really 
        like Character X and Y," if they asked for 'Any,' then they asked for 'Any.'

      <p>Conversely, if you offered to write 'Any' and your recipient asked for specific 
        characters, then you must write those specific characters, since you said 
        you could and would. Unless there was an actual error, please give it your best shot. 
      If you offered 'Any' in a fandom and got taken up on it in an unexpected way -- them's 
      the breaks for you. 

      <p>If you fail to write the characters requested, and your recipient contacts us, we may 
        determine that you failed to fulfill the minimum requirements of the challenge, 
        and ban you from future participation.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>  

      <p> <a name="31"></a><strong> Can I talk about my assignment with other people? </strong> 
      <p>While we want assignments to stay as secret as possible, 
        we do prefer you have your stories betaed, and we know that some authors need 
        to talk out their story ideas. All we ask is that you do your best to keep your 
        assignment a secret, only share details with others who are also willing to 
        keep that secret, and not post anything publicly that will connect you to a 
        particular fandom or the specifics of any story request. Given that these are 
        rare fandoms, it's quite possible that only one or two people have requested 
        the fandom you're writing for, so any identifying information can reveal the 
        secret. 

      <p>Along these lines, we ask that you not complain publicly 
        (on lists, blogs, or LJ, even locked, because these things have a way of getting 
        out) about your assignment in a way that would possibly upset/offend/hurt your 
        recipient. "Yuletide is kicking my ass!" is okay. "My assignment is so stupid/I 
        can't believe anyone wants <i>this</i>" is not. Please don't make judgmental remarks 
        about your recipient's taste or requests because they don't match your own. 
        You never know who's reading your LJ, or who might remember, even if you delete
      the post in question.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="32"></a><strong> I don't really know any 
        of the fandoms my recipient asked for very well. I didn't think I'd get assigned 
        any of those. What do I do? </strong> 
      <p><strong>DO NOT SIGN UP FOR ANY FANDOMS YOU AREN'T MORE 
        THAN HAPPY TO WRITE. </strong>Really, please. The program 
        assigns any single matches (they're the only one who asked, you're the only 
        one who offered) first, and anything you sign up for, you might get a chance 
        to write. 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="33"></a><strong> My recipient listed a 
        fandom that I didn't sign up for, but I have an idea. Can I write in that fandom, 
        instead? </strong> 
      <p>Absolutely! Once you get your recipient's wishlist, you're 
        free to write in any of the fandoms on that list, whether you signed up for 
        it or not. If you luck out and get a recipient who has requested more than one 
        fandom you could write in, even if you didn't offer them, then you have your 
        pick! 


      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="34"></a><strong> I'm not comfortable with the fandoms I offered that my recipient wanted, but I have 
        this other fandom I like/there's this other fandom I see she likes on her LJ/website 
        that I could write. Can I do that? </strong> 
      <p>No. You are limited to the fandoms and characters that your recipient requested, at least one of 
      which you offered to write. If you fail to do so, we may determine that you failed to fulfill the 
      requirements of the challenge, and ban you from future participation.

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="35"></a><strong> How can I provide my author with more information? </strong> 

      <p>If you want to post a letter to your Yuletide writer in your LJ 
        or blog, we're all for that!  There will also be a post in the basic Yuletide community where you can
      comment with a post or link to an entry in your own LJ/blog. The <a href="#14">section on writing prompts</a> might give you
      some ideas on the kinds of things to include. Keep in mind that general may work better than too specific. 
      Things like "I love angst! Death for Yuletide!" or "I don't need explicit sex (but it's okay if you want to include it)" 
      or "my tastes are broad; just write what pleases you!" give your writer something to work with, without dictating exactly
      what you expect them to do. Laying out a specific plotline you want your writer to follow doesn't really allow for the 
      flexibility that makes Yuletide work. 

      <p><a href="#top">Top</a> | <a href="#assignment">After You Get Your Assignment </a>

      <p><a name="36"></a><strong>Defaulting: I'm not going to be able 
        to complete my assignment, what do I do? Can I have an extension? </strong> 

      <p>If you aren't going to be able to fulfill your commitment, <b>let us know as soon as possible</b> 
      at <a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a>, 
      and include the exact name and email address under which you signed up. 


      <p><i>Please</i> don't just disappear without a word to us. The sooner we know, the easier it is 
      to find a pinch hitter for your recipient, and the more time they have to write. Additionally, defaulting
      without notification is grounds for a permanent Yuletide ban. 

      <p>Though we know that there can be unavoidable reasons for defaulting, we will not grant
      any extensions, so please don't ask. Aside from the fact that it's not fair to everyone 
        else, after 9:00 p.m. December 21st we'll be going through the people who didn't get 
        a story and trying to assign last-minute pinch hitters, in an effort to make 
        sure everyone ends up with a story. We will need all the time between then and the 
      25th to get that done and to make sure everything's working for when we go live. 

      <p><strong>Defaulting deadlines:</strong> 
      If you default by 11:59 p.m. <a href="http://www.worldtimezone.com/">Eastern Time (ET)</a>, December 7th, and you notify us, you remain eligible for future 
      Yuletide participation without penalty or qualification, no questions asked. We will still 
      keep a record of this default for the future, however.

      <p>If you default after December 7th, you may be banned from future participation. We will look at 
      your past default history when we make our decision, which may include no penalty, a requirement to 
      write a NYR story before the next year's signups, or banning from future Yuletide participation.

      <p>We are willing to consider extenuating circumstances, but <b>final exams, holiday family commitments, 
      last-minute shopping  -- these are not extenuating circumstances</b>. Known or anticipated obstacles should already be
      factored into your decision to sign up or not.

      <p>Defaulting without notifying us or defaulting two years in a row will lead to being banned from future 
      Yuletide participation.

      <p><a name="37"></a><strong> I need a beta, what do I do? </strong> 
      <p>The problem with soliciting a beta publicly is that you 
        generally will have to reveal the fandom, and this will interfere with the "secret" 
        part of the challenge. If you just need a general beta, you can ask in your 
        LJ, or the Yuletide LJ, and see who offers -- and not choose your recipient, 
        if they offer. If you need a more fandom-specific beta, you might try advertising 
        on an LJ or list specific to that fandom, and not specifically identify it as 
        a Yuletide story. There will also be a "Beta" post on the Yuletide LJ, where people
      can post saying what fandoms they're able to beta.

      <p>If you don't know anyone who you feel can beta your story 
        properly because of the obscurity of the fandom, you can contact us and we will 
        <i>try</i> (we make no promises) to find you someone who volunteered to write 
        that fandom who is willing to beta. Please use this option as a last resort!

      <p><a name="38"></a><strong> What are the minimum 
        requirements for my story? </strong> 
      <p>You will receive three or four fandom requests from your recipient, with accompanying character requests and 
        possible specific comments. You are required to write a minimum of 1,000
        words in one of these fandoms, using all of the requested characters (unless the recipient's
      details indicate that they don't mind if you don't include them all). You are not bound 
        by any further comments, although we ask that you try and take your recipient's 
        wishes into account (are you sensing a theme, here?).

      <p><a name="39"></a><strong> Does my story have to 
        be a holiday story? </strong> 
      <p>Not at all! You don't have to write a holiday story, 
        nor does it have to be set at this particular time of year -- it can be about 
        anything at all. Obviously, if it works for your fandom and you have a great 
        idea (or your recipient specifically asks for it), then by all means have at it. 
      However, if you do want to write a holiday story, it would be a good idea to write 
      the mods and ask them to see if your recipient would also enjoy that.

      <p><a name="41"></a><strong> How do I upload my story? 
        </strong> 
      <p>For 2009, uploading will not be available until early December, after the archive
      has been moved to the <a href="http://archiveofourown.org/">Archive of Our Own (AO3)</a>.
      More information will be sent out by email and posted to the Admin LJ when it's available.

      more information on this is forthcoming, but if you already have an account on AO3, you can
      see how it will work.


      <p>Please don't ask us to upload your story for you. If you're not going to be able to upload your story yourself, you
      can ask a friend, or check the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide/">Yuletide LJ</a>; there is generally a post where people have offered to upload stories for other participants. 
      If there's no such post, you can ask in a post of your own. There are always other participants willing to help; when someone offers, send them your text file
       and the relevant info: name, email address, LJ and/or website if desired, ratings, summary, author notes.

      <p><a name="43"></a><strong> Can I thank my beta/include author notes in my story? </strong> 
      <p>Any author notes, email addresses, beta thank-yous, or other information that may betray your 
      identity should go in the Author Notes field (NOT the story summary field) when you upload the story. 
      This information, as well as your email, website, and LJ address, if available, will be hidden from view 
      on the story until January 1. 

      <p>Please do not include any information that may betray your identity in the story 
        file itself or in the summary. General story notes on the story itself 
        are okay, but check out the preview to see how it looks. Including notes at 
        the bottom of your text file may be preferable. 

      <p>If you're in doubt about whether the content will betray 
        your anonymity, email <a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a> to ask! Once the 
        authors are revealed on New Year's Day, all participants are free to post their

      <p>You will receive emailed copies of all comments left on your stories. Do not delete these if you wish

      <p>To prevent spammers from harvesting addresses, the only place a commenter's email address exists (if they

      <p><strong><a name="45"></a>Can I post my story to my LJ/website/another archive?</strong>

      <p>You can post your story anywhere you want after the author reveal on January 1st! However, by signing up for Yuletide and uploading a story, 
      you are agreeing to let us keep that story in the archive, for good. We will not agree to delete the story
      at any later date, for any reason, although we will remove all identifying information at your request. 

      <p>These are not stories you write in isolation: these are gifts you write for 
      other people, to their prompts; you get a story of your own in return; and you have taken advantage of 
      the work done to make the challenge work. Asking us to delete your story after you have gotten a story in 
      return and collected your feedback is really not fair to your recipient or to the community. Someone spent 
      their Yuletide requests to get a story created in a rare fandom of their heart, which may have very little 
      else available or easily found online, and removing the story would rob them of that.

      <p><h2> <strong><a name="madness" id="madness"></a>Yuletide Madness</strong></h2> 
      <p>Yuletide Madness is the mods' way of ensuring that everyone has something to read when the Yuletide stories 
      go live on December 25th. We get nervous on December 23rd when there are still participants without stories, 
      even if we know that their pinch hitters are still working, because very occasionally one of our pinch hitters defaults. 
      So sometime on the 23rd or 24th of December, the remaining unfulfilled assignments are made available to our Yuletide participants, 
      who can then write something for anyone on the list. On the 24th, we remove the word limits on the archive and let our 
      participants write drabbles or snippets for any of the other participants, little Yuletide follies for sheer fun. Our 
      view is that it's more for everyone to read!

      <p><h2> <strong><a name="etiquette" id="etiquette"></a>Yuletide Etiquette</strong> </h2> 
      <p>In response to several different incidents, we feel we 
        need to clarify what we mean when we ask that everyone approach their Yuletide 
        assignment and story graciously. Basically it boils down to: please be polite!

      <p> In Yuletide terms, this means that if you don't like the requests you receive, please don't 
      complain in public, or comment negatively on your recipient's taste or requests. If you get something 
      you didn't sign up for, email privately (<a href="mailto:yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org">yuletide@yuletidetreasure.org</a>) 
        and we'll fix it. Otherwise, match the fandom you offered and the characters requested and write the best 
        story you can, and try to make it something you think your recipient will enjoy. 

      <p> Please leave a thank-you comment for your writer. You aren't obligated to rave publicly 
      or rec the story if you aren't enthusiastic about it, but an appreciative comment thanking
      them for their time and effort is simply polite, and will end their Yuletide experience on a positive note.
      Leave a comment even if you default -- you may feel too embarrassed to say thank you when you didn't give something yourself, 
      but silence will make your author think you hated the story or couldn't even be bothered to read it.


      <p> Please don't complain about your gift in public. If you 
        get something that doesn't match your fandom/character requests, contact us 
        in private and we'll handle it. If you get something that matches your fandom/characters 
        but isn't to your taste, please say thank you anyway and move on to the <i>hundreds</i> of 
      other stories available to read and enjoy. And maybe someone will pick out one of your unused 
      requests to write for the NYR challenge!

      <p>If you aren't happy with your Yuletide experience, or comfortable with the gift-exchange atmosphere, 
      where it really is the thought that counts, then please do not sign up to participate in Yuletide in future. 
      Join other challenges where stories aren't given as gifts, or pick a NYR request that you can write to your 
        own taste, without worrying about tailoring it to someone else.

      <p>Yuletide maintains two LJs: <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/yuletide_admin">Yuletide Admin</a> for all 
      official notices (only mods can post here), and the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/yuletide">
        Yuletide community</a> for participant discussion and posting. We do not allow either flames or anonymous 
      posting in either community. Anonymous comments <i>are</i> enabled, so that people without livejournals can 
      participate, but if you need to use this option, please sign your name. Any unsigned anonymous comments will 
      be deleted as soon as we see them. 


      <p><strong>I've made some Yuletide story recommendations/have 
        some comments about Yuletide, can I post them to the Yuletide community? 
        </strong> 
      <p>Absolutely! Since many of us have come from vastly different 
        walks of fandom, we may miss many privately posted reviews/comments about Yuletide. So by all means, 
      go ahead and post links in the community! 

      <p>See the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/yuletide/profile">Yuletide community profile</a> for 
      further explanation of the types of posts allowed.

      <p><h2> <strong><a name="nyr" id="nyr"></a>What is the New Year's 
        Resolution Challenge? </strong> </h2> 

      <p>Because of the way the Yuletide challenge is set up, with each 
        participant requesting several fandoms for their writers to choose from, many 
        more stories are requested than written. 

      <p>After the authors have been revealed on January 1st, a list of all unfilled requests 
      is posted to the archive. From then until signups begin for the next year's Yuletide challenge,
      anyone who wants to can fill one of these requests and upload it to the archive.

      <p>Each new NYR story that is uploaded will be automatically announced to the Yuletide community
      LJ when the next <a href="#story">Story of the Day</a> post goes out.

      <p>Just like with Yuletide, matching the fandom and characters 
        of a request and meeting the minimum 1,000-word limit is all we require, although 
        we prefer that it be reasonably proofread as well. To be posted to the archive, 
        a story must have a specific recipient, but while we hope you'll take the recipient's 
        specific requests into consideration, it's not obligatory.

      <p>We will not delete requests as they are filled, but 
        we do ask that you try and fulfill unanswered ones if you can, rather than one 
        that's already gotten one or more responses. But if you've already started 
        a story for a given request, don't give up on it just because someone beat you 
        to posting it. Or if you just get particularly inspired by a given request -- 
        go ahead. In the end, it all adds to the richness of the archive.

      <p>Every day from January 1st to October 1st, a post is automatically made to the Yuletide community LJ
      containing:
      <ul>
      <li>A set number of stories from the most recent Yuletide challenge, posted in order of upload

        insane woman made the suggestion</a> that other crazy people might challenge 
        themselves by clicking on <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/get_random_req.cgi">the 
        random request link</a> on the <a href="http://yuletidetreasure.org/unfilled.shtml">Unfilled
