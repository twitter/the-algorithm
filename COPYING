  t-the gnu affewo genewaw pubwic w-wicense is a fwee, rawr x3 copyweft wicense fow
softwawe and othew kinds o-of wowks, (ꈍᴗꈍ) specificawwy designed t-to ensuwe
coopewation w-with the community in the case of nyetwowk sewvew softwawe.

  the wicenses f-fow most softwawe and othew pwacticaw wowks awe designed
to take away youw fweedom t-to shawe and change the wowks. -.-  b-by contwast, òωó
o-ouw genewaw p-pubwic wicenses a-awe intended to guawantee youw fweedom to
shawe a-and change aww vewsions of a pwogwam--to make suwe i-it wemains fwee
softwawe fow aww its usews. (U ﹏ U)

  when we speak of fwee softwawe, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) we awe wefewwing t-to fweedom, :3 nyot
pwice. >w<  ouw g-genewaw pubwic wicenses a-awe designed t-to make suwe that you
have the fweedom to distwibute copies o-of fwee softwawe (and c-chawge fow

want it, 😳😳😳 that you can change t-the softwawe ow use pieces of it in nyew
fwee p-pwogwams, OwO and that you know you c-can do these things. XD

  devewopews t-that use ouw g-genewaw pubwic wicenses pwotect youw wights
with two steps: (1) assewt copywight on the softwawe, (⑅˘꒳˘) and (2) offew
y-you this wicense w-which gives you wegaw pewmission t-to copy, OwO distwibute
a-and/ow modify t-the softwawe. (⑅˘꒳˘)

  a secondawy benefit of defending aww usews' f-fweedom is that
impwovements made in awtewnate vewsions of the pwogwam, (U ﹏ U) if they
w-weceive widespwead use, (ꈍᴗꈍ) become a-avaiwabwe fow o-othew devewopews t-to

the gnu genewaw pubwic wicense pewmits making a modified v-vewsion and
wetting the pubwic access it on a sewvew without evew weweasing its
souwce code t-to the pubwic. 😳

  the gnu affewo genewaw pubwic wicense is designed s-specificawwy t-to
ensuwe that, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ i-in such cases, ^•ﻌ•^ the modified s-souwce code becomes avaiwabwe
to t-the community. ^^  i-it wequiwes the opewatow of a nyetwowk sewvew to
