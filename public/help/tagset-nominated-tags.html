<h4>Nominated Tags</h4>

<p>
  Some of your tags may be marked as <span class="unwrangled">unwrangled</span>, meaning they currently exist in the archive but have
  not been organized into our tagging system, and some may be marked as <span class="nonexistent">nonexistent</span>, meaning
  they don't exist in the archive at all. If you have tags marked this way, please make sure you have them typed correctly!
</p>

<p>
  If you see one of your tags listed with a slightly different tag afterwards in parentheses, this means that the
  tag you have nominated is wrangled and has a canonical synonym on the archive. The moderators may decide to use
  the canonical synonym instead of the version you used.
