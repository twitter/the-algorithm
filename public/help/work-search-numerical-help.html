<h4>Work Search: Numerical Values</h4>

<p>Use the following guidelines when looking for works with a specific amount of words, hits, kudos, comments, or bookmarks. Note that periods and commas are ignored: 1.000 = 1,000 = 1000.

<dl>
  <dt>10:</dt>
  <dd>a single number will find works with that exact amount</dd>
  <dt>&lt;100:</dt>
  <dd>will find works with less than that amount</dd>
  <dt>&gt;100:</dt>
  <dd>will find works with more than that amount</dd>
  <dt>100-1000:</dt>
  <dd>will find works in the range of 100 to 1000</dd>
</dl>
