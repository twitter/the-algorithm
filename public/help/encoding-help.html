<h4>Encoding Help</h4>

<p>If you find that the importer strips special characters (such as umlauts or curly quotes) from your work, or fails to import whole chunks of text, there might be a problem with the automatic detection of your work's encoding. UTF-8 is a common encoding, but there are others that you might have to manually put in to help the importer handle your work.</p>

<p>If you're unsure what encoding your text is using, try ISO-8859-1 (often called Latin-1) or Windows-1252 (sometimes wrongly called ANSI), both of which 
  are very common in the output from Windows programs.</p>
