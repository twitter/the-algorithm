<h4>Moderated Collection</h4>

<p>
  By default, collections are not moderated, which means any registered user of the Archive can add
  their works to the collection. The owners/moderators of the collection can still reject stories
  after they have been posted, if they are not appropriate.  
</p>
  
<p>
  If you set your collection to be moderated, all registered users will still be able to post, but their
  stories will not appear in the collection until they are approved by a moderator or owner. Approved
  members will be able to post automatically without manual approval. 
</p>

<p>
  Owners of a collection can edit the collection preferences and data, and also delete the collection
  entirely. Moderators of a collection can approve/invite members and add/reject stories.
