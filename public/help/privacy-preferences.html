<dl id="help">
  <dt>Show my email address to other people.</dt>
  <dd>
    When this option is enabled, the email address associated with your account will be publicly visible on your user profile page.
  </dd>
  <dt>Show my date of birth to other people.</dt>
  <dd>
    When this option is enabled, the date of birth associated with your account will be publicly visible on your user profile page.
  </dd>
  <dt>Hide my work from search engines when possible.</dt>
  <dd>
    Enabling this option will tell search engines not to index your user page, your works, or your series. Please note that not all search engines respect this setting. Pages which list your works or series - for example, the main works page - may also still be indexed. If you wish to avoid your works or series being indexed under any circumstances, we recommend that you restrict them to Archive users only.
  </dd>
  <dt>Hide the share buttons on my work.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      This preference allows you to disable the one-click share buttons which allow others to recommend your work 
      on external sites like Twitter and Tumblr.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that once you have posted a work online, it is always possible for a reader to copy and paste a link to your work
      anywhere they wish -- if you want to restrict access to your work here, your best bet is to lock the work to registered users of 
      the Archive. 
    </p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Allow others to invite me to be a co-creator.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Enabling this option will allow other AO3 users to invite you to be listed
      as a co-creator on a work, chapter, or series. You won't be listed as a
      co-creator anywhere on the site until you have accepted the request. If
      you have this option enabled, you can find any requests you receive in
      your Dashboard under "Co-Creator Requests". You will also receive an email
      notifying you of the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving this option disabled will prevent other users from inviting you to
      be listed as a co-creator on a new work, chapter or series, and you won't
      receive any notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Changing this setting won't affect any existing shared works.
    </p>
