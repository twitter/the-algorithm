<h5>Tag Options: Characters and Relationships</h5>

<p>
  Very often, you will want your users to only be able to choose from the characters or relationships that 
  belong to the fandom that they've chosen to sign up for. Unfortunately the archive can't figure out on its own that, 
  for instance, the character "Zaphod Beeblebrox" is associated with the fandom "Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy". 
  These options are intended to help you get the results you want.

  <dt>Option 1: Nothing!</dt>
  <dd>
    By default, your participants will get an autocomplete that lets the user choose from the 
    canonical versions of character and relationship tags.
    This is a quick and dirty way to ensure most of your participants will sign up for the same versions of the characters 
    or relationships and be matchable, even if you have so many characters/relationships that you don't want to create 
    a tag set. Users will have to know at least enough of the tag they want to type in to get autocomplete results, 
    but that is usually doable. 
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Option 2: Tag Set</dt>
  <dd>
    If you put character or relationship tags in your tag set, users will be given a set of checkboxes with each tag as a choice. 
    This set of checkboxes will NOT change based on the fandom. 
  </dd>

  <dt>Option 3: Fandom Only</dt>
  <dd>    
    If you check this option, participants will only be allowed to sign up for a character or relationship that
    matches the fandom they have chosen in the request. The list of characters/relationships will be a combination
    of the tags that have been officially wrangled into that fandom, as well as any tag associations you have set up
    for that fandom in your tag set(s) if you are using any. 
  </dd>
    
  <dt>Option 4: By Tag Set Fandom Only</dt>
  <dd>
    If you don't want all the wrangled characters available, then check this option, and ONLY the characters you've 
    associated in your tag set will be allowed. 
  </dd>
