<h4>Optional Tags</h4>

<p>
  Optional tags will be used by the moderator to try and improve matching, but may be discarded completely if 
  necessary to make a match. This is a good place to add more obscure and specific tags. 
  Note that the more tags you enter, the more likely it is your optional tags will have to be ignored, 
  and the slower matching runs, so don't go nuts!
