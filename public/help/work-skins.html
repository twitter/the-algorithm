<h4>Work Skins</h4>

<p>
  You can create custom stylesheets, or "skins", for your works just like you
  can create skins for the Archive. The main difference is that work skins will
  change the way your work appears to <strong>other</strong> users, not just
  you.
</p>

<p>
  Work skins will <strong>only</strong> affect the body of the work they are
  applied toâ€”you can't change the Archive navigation or background with them.
  What you can do, however, is create your own classes. For instance, you can
  change the color of some of your text, indent some paragraphs in a particular
  way, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  For example, let's say that you want to make a single word in your text bright
  blue. Here is what you might do:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/skins/new?skin_type=WorkSkin">Create a work skin</a> with the
    following content: <code>.bluetext {color: blue;}</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Select this skin when posting your work.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the HTML of your text, you would then give the word this class: <code>I
    want &lt;span class="bluetext">house&lt;/span> to be in blue</code>
  </li>
</ul>
