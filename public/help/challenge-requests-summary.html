<h4>Public Sign-up Summary</h4>

<p>
  If you choose this option, all users will be able to view the requests that have been made for your challenge. 
  This can encourage people to make matching offers or write extra stories for participants, but does create
  spoilers for requests. You may want to only turn this on later, after your exchange has finished, in order to let users write
  unfilled requests.
