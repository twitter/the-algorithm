<h4>Relationships Tags</h4>

<p>(For more information, see the <a href="/faq/tags">Tags on the Archive FAQ</a>.)</p>

<p>The relationships in your work. Full names are preferred (for example, "Mickey Mouse/Minnie Mouse" or "Rodney McKay & John Sheppard"). You may list more than one relationship, separated by commas. Please note that all user-created tags must be 100 characters or less; if your work contains a threesome (or a larger poly group) you may want to use first names only to avoid going over the character limit.</p>
