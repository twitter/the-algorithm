<h3>Tag Set Associations</h3>

<p>
  Tag associations let you set up associations between the fandoms, characters, and relationships in your tag set, which then 
  lets your participants pick from only the characters and relationships in a given fandom.
</p>

<p>
  Note: if the wranglers have already set up these associations, then you can just add the additional
  ones that you would like -- you don't have to (and in fact aren't allowed) to create copies of canonical 
  associations. You can still limit your participants' choices to tags actually in your set.
</p>

<p>
  If you're not sure how this might work, try adding a few fandoms and characters and setting up some associations,
  and then set up your challenge and try out the sign-up form!
