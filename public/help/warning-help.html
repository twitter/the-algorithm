<h4>Warning Tags</h4>

<p>
  The Archive of Our Own has chosen, for legal and other reasons, to mandate
  that users either warn for&mdash;or explicitly choose not to warn for&mdash;a
  short list of common warnings: Graphic Depictions of Violence, Major Character
  Death, Rape/Non-Con, and Underage. We understand that creators may wish to not
  warn for some of these things, or to warn for additional content, and have
  provided options for them to do so within this framework.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    Choose Not To Use Archive Warnings:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Use this if you don't want to warn for anything. You may also choose this
    option if you don't know what you should warn for; if you don't like warning
    for certain topics or warnings in general; if you want to avoid some
    spoilers, but not others; etc.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Graphic Depictions Of Violence:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is for gory, graphic, explicitly described violence. Exactly where to
    draw the line is your call.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Major Character Death:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Please use your best judgment about who counts as a major character.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    No Archive Warnings Apply:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Use this if the Archive warnings don't apply to your content. (In other
    words, if it contains no graphic depictions of violence, major character
    death, rape/non-con, or underage sexual activity.)
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Rape/Non-Con:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is your call. If you think your content may be seen as containing
    non-consensual sexual activity, but you don't feel like using this warning
    or you're not sure if you should, you always have the option of using
    "Choose Not to Use Archive Warnings" instead.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    Underage:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is for descriptions or depictions of sexual activity by characters
    under the age of eighteen. (This doesn't include dating activity like
    kissing or vague references with no actual description or depiction.) This
    warning generally applies to humans; if you are creating a pornographic work
    about space aliens who only live for a month or thousand-year-old vampires
    with twelve-year-old bodies, please just use your best judgment. You are
    always free to specify characters' ages or to use "Choose Not to Use Archive
    Warnings".
