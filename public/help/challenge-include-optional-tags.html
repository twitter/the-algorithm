<h4>Include Optional Tags</h4>

<p>
  If you choose this option, then any optional tags you allowed people to set will be used to fulfill 
  required matches on this field. Otherwise, matches on optional tags will only be used to increase the ranking
  of the match.
</p>

<h5>Example:</h5>

<p>
  A challenge requires people to offer and request two fandoms, but also allows them to enter extra fandoms in the optional tags. 
  The moderator promises assignments will match on at least one fandom (and therefore chooses "1" as the number of required fandoms to match). 
</p>

<ul>
<li>Jane signs up and requests Smallville and Queer As Folk UK. In her optional tags, she also lists Sesame Street.</li>

<li>Bob signs up and offers Sesame Street and Project Runway.</li>

<li>Sue signs up and offers Smallville and American Idol RPF. She also offers Sesame Street in her optional tags.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  If the moderator turns on "include optional tags" for fandoms, then both Bob and Sue will be potential matches for Jane. 
  Otherwise, only Sue will match with Jane. 
  In both cases, Sue will be ranked as a better match because she also matches Jane in her optional tags.
