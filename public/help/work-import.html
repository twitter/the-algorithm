<h4>Troubleshooting Importing</h4>

<p>
  If your text gets cut off at the point of an em dash or accented character,
  you might have to manually set the encoding using the "Set custom encoding"
  menu below for your work to import successfully. The type of encoding that
  works can vary; you may need to try different options to find the right one.
  Refer to the <a href="/help/encoding-help.html">Encoding Help page</a> for
  more information.
</p>

<p>
  If you are importing a chaptered work from an e-fiction site, you need to
  enter the URL for each chapter, each one on a different line. You can import a
  maximum of two hundred chapters at a time. For more information on importing
  works from other sites, please refer to <a
  href="/faq/posting-and-editing#importwork">"How do I import works from another
  website?"</a>
</p>

<p>
  If you are trying to transfer a work already on the Archive of Our Own from
  one user account to another, you must edit the existing work to add the new
  account as a co-creator, then remove the old account. You can't use the Import
  tool on AO3-hosted works.
</p>

<p>
  Unless you check the "Override tags and notes" box, any information you enter
  under Tags will only be used if the importer cannot determine tags from the
  work itself.
</p>

<p>
  You will be able to edit and complete the standard header information after
  the import has been completed. For more information on posting and editing,
  please refer to the <a href="/faq/posting-and-editing">Posting and Editing
  FAQ</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If none of the above information is helpful to you, you might find your
  problem listed on the the <a href="/known_issues#importing">Known Issues</a>
  page.
