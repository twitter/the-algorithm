<h4>Challenge Assignments</h4>

<p>
  You can review the assignments for your challenge in several different categories. 
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Defaulted</dt>
  <dd>The most urgent: the assigned person has defaulted and
    the recipient needs a substitute (a "pinch hitter") assigned.</dd>
    
  <dt>Pinch Hits</dt>
  <dd>You've assigned a pinch hitter.</dd>
  
  <dt>Open</dt>
  <dd>The assigned person hasn't posted their work yet, or 
    you haven't approved their work (if your collection is moderated).</dd> 

  <dt>Complete</dt>
  <dd>The work has been posted (and approved if your collection is moderated).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  If a work is posted that does not meet your challenge standards, you can remove it from the collection under the
  <tt>Manage Items</tt> page and the work will be removed from the listing, at which point you will be able to 
  come back to the assignments page and mark the writer as having defaulted.
</p> 
  
<p>
  <strong>NOTE:</strong> if your collection is unrevealed or
  anonymous, removing the work from the collection will cause it to be revealed!
