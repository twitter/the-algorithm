<h4>Recipients</h4>

<p>
  Enter recipient names as a comma-separated list!

<p>
  If your story is a gift for someone else or in their honor, you can enter their name here, and it will be displayed on the work, right under the byline. 
  Recipients do <strong>not</strong> need to be registered users of the archive, although the autocomplete will offer you matching pseuds if there are any. We will notify registered users if they are selected as recipients of a work.
