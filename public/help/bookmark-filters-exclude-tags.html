<h4>Tag Filters: Exclude Tags</h4>

<p>
  The filters list the ten most popular tags for each tag category. To filter by any other tags, use the "Other work tags to exclude" or "Other bookmarker's tags to exclude" fields.
</p>

<p>
  If the tag you want to exclude isn't in the top ten, start entering the tag you need in either the "Other work tags to exclude" or "Other bookmarker's tags to exclude" field&mdash;all tag categories are valid here, and you can add as many tags as you want. The autocomplete will help you find the <em>canonical</em> version of the tag. Use these to take full advantage of the wrangled tagging structure, which will exclude all works using subtags and tags with synonymous meanings.
</p>

<p>
  You can also enter tags that aren't in the autocomplete. If the tag you enter has been used on the Archive but is not marked canonical, then the filters will look for works that use the exact tag you've entered. If the tag you've entered has never been used on the Archive, but in that case the filters will do a simple text match and may bring up unexpected results. The "Search within results" and "Search bookmarker's tags and notes" fields will text-match more accurately, especially in the case of relationship tags and other tags with "/" or other non-text characters.
</p>

<p>
  Choosing any tag from a category or entering a tag in the "Other work tags to exclude" or "Other bookmarker's tags to exclude" field will do an OR search with all the tags you select. This means that if you're filtering the <a href="/tags/F*s*F/bookmarks">bookmarks tagged with the F/F category</a>, select the <samp>Major Character Death</samp> warning, the canonical <samp>Alternate Universe</samp> tag in the Additional Tags category, and enter or select the canonical tag <samp>Drama</samp> in the "Other work tags to exclude" field, only <a href="/bookmarks?utf8=âœ“&bookmark_search%5Bsort_column%5D=created_at&bookmark_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bother_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&exclude_bookmark_search%5Bwarning_ids%5D%5B%5D=18&exclude_bookmark_search%5Bfreeform_ids%5D%5B%5D=968&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=Drama&bookmark_search%5Bexcluded_bookmark_tag_names%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmarkable_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Bbookmark_query%5D=&bookmark_search%5Brec%5D=0&bookmark_search%5Bwith_notes%5D=0&commit=Sort+and+Filter&tag_id=F*s*F">bookmarks of works or series tagged without <em>any</em> of these tags</a> will be included in the results.
