<h4>Public Skins</h4>

<p>
  <abbr title="Archive of Our Own">AO3</abbr> is no longer adding new
  user-created skins to the list of public skins, so you can't apply to make
  your skin public at this time. This checkbox can only be used by site admins
  to add new public site skins to our list. However, you can still make use of
  the user-created skins in <a href="/skins?skin_type=Site">Public Site
  Skins</a> and <a href="/skins?skin_type=WorkSkin">Public Work Skins</a> and
  you can still create skins for your own personal use.
