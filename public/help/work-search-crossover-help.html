<h4>Work Search: Crossovers</h4>

<p>
  Generally speaking, a <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Crossover">crossover</a> is a work with more than one fandom. For filtering purposes, a work is considered a crossover if it's tagged with two or more <em>unrelated</em> fandoms (we're using our tag wrangling system to make that determination).

  Looking for crossovers between two specific fandoms? Enter their names in the "Fandoms" field on the search form or select or enter both fandoms on the filters.
