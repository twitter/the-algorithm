<h4>About Tag Sets</h4>

<p>
  If you've ever wanted to run a challenge on the Archive, that's what tag sets
  are for. You create a tag set to hold a list of all the tags that should be
  available for sign-up, even if those tags haven't been used on the Archive
  before now, and then add the tag set to your challenge. Tags in the tag set
  will then automatically show up in the sign-up form.
</p>

<p>
  You can add as many moderators as you want to help you manage your tag set,
  and they don't need to have access to the challenge settings. You can also
  allow the participants in your challenge to nominate tags to be added to your
  set. You and any co-owners and moderators can review those nominations, and
  approve or reject them. You can add fandom associations to new tags in your
  Tag Set, or you can leave them for tag wranglers to make the associations
  (this may take some time).
</p>

<p>
  All tag sets are listed on the main tag sets page. You can browse them to get
  a better idea of how they work.
</p>

<p>
  Some users may choose to make their tag set publicly available for others to
  use in their challenges. Please note that the owners of a tag set <strong>can
  delete the tag set or change it without warning</strong>, so before you use
  someone else's tag set for your challenge, please be sure that you trust them
  not to change it.
