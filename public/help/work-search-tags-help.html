<h4>Work Search: Tags</h4>

<p>
  The fields for Fandoms, Characters, Relationships, and Additional Tags suggest
  tags as you enter search terms. Choosing the "canonical" or common tag, (that
  is, the ones included in the autocomplete list) will return all results
  containing this tag, its synonyms, and the subtags linked with the tag. For
  example, picking the canonical relationship tag <samp>Erika Mustermann/Juan
  P&eacute;rez</samp> will return works tagged <samp>Juan P&eacute;rez/Erika
  Mustermann</samp> as well, assuming these tags have been linked by a wrangler
  in the background. Refer to <a href="/faq/tags#whatcanonical">What is a
  'canonical' tag?</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
  If a tag doesn't appear in the autocomplete menu, it doesn't necessarily mean
  that the tag doesn't exist on the Archive; it just hasn't been marked as
  common by a tag wrangler. You can enter any word or phrase here. If your
  phrase doesn't match a common tag exactly, it will find all tags containing
  the words in your phrase. Entering <kbd>People Doing Things</kbd>, for
  example, will also find works tagged <samp>Nice People Doing Things</samp>,
  <samp>People Doing Shady Things</samp>, and <samp>People Doing Things with
  Spoons</samp>. Depending on your search, results in this case will be somewhat
  unpredictable.
</p>

<p>
  The more search terms you enter or options you pick, the more your search
  results will be narrowed down. By default, all the search results are AND
  search results. This means that entering two fandoms will only find works
  tagged with both, not all works that are in one fandom <em>or</em> the other.
  Entering two characters will only find works that have both. Picking
  <samp>M/M</samp> and <samp>F/M</samp> will only include a work in the search
  results if it has both category tags, and so on.
