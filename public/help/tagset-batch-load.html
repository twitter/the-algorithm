<h4>Batch Loading</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can only batch load tag associations if the tags already exist. This is
    to avoid mass-adding piles of wrong tags to the Archive.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you really want to add some new tags to the Archive, you can add them to
    your tag set first, and then batch load the associations here afterwards.
  </li>
  <li>
    If two tags are already associated in the Archive or in your tag set, it
    won't associate them again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Only the associations that didn't work will remain in the form after you
    select the "Submit" button.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the batch load is taking too long and you're getting 502 errors, please
    split up the number of tags you're trying to load!
  </li>
</ul>
