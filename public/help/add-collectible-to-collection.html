<h4>Adding To Collections</h4>

<p>
  Enter collection names as a comma-separated list, and the item you are editing will be added to all the collections you specify.
</p> 
  
<p>
  Note that you need to use the collection's name, which gets used in the collection's URL, and not the collection's spiffy title (because different collections can have the same title). A collection's name is the equivalent of your user login. Names will be auto-completed for you if you have JavaScript turned on.
</p>
  
<p>
  Also note: if the collection you are submitting to is moderated, and you aren't a member, your story will not be added to the collection automatically - it will have to be approved by one of the collection's moderators. If this is an anonymous and/or unrevealed collection your work will be anonymous and/or hidden as soon as you post it, including while it's waiting for approval. If your work is rejected, it will remain anonymous and/or unrevealed until you edit it to remove it from the collection or until the moderator removes it.
</p>

<p>
  If you change your mind about having an item in a collection, you can either edit the list of collections
  when editing it, or you can manage all your collected items under the "My Collections" page in your account.
