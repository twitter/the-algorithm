<h4>Work Search: Any Field</h4>

<p>Searches all the fields associated with a work in the database, including summary, notes and tags, but not the full work text.</p>

<p>The characters ":" and "@" have special meanings. Leave them out of your search or you will get unexpected results. Like in the Title and Author/Artist field, you can use the following operators to combine your search terms:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>*: any characters </dt>
  <dd><kbd>book*</kbd> will find <samp>book</samp> and <samp>books</samp> and <samp>booking</samp>.</dd>
  
  <dt>space: acts like AND for search terms in the same field of the work </dt>
  <dd><kbd>Harry Potter</kbd> will find <samp>Harry Potter</samp> and <samp>Harry James Potter</samp> in any field, but it won't find works by a creator named <samp>Harry</samp> with the character tag <samp>Sherman Potter</samp>.</dd>

  <dt>AND: searches for works which have both terms in any field </dt>
  <dd><kbd>Harry AND Potter</kbd> will find works by a creator named <samp>Harry</samp> with the character tag <samp>Sherman Potter</samp>.</dd>
  
  <dt>||: OR (not exclusive) </dt>
  <dd><kbd>Harry || Potter</kbd> will find <samp>Harry</samp>, <samp>Harry Potter</samp>, and <samp>Potter</samp>.</dd>
  
  <dt>"": words in exact sequence </dt>
  <dd><kbd>"Harry Lockhart"</kbd> will find <samp>Harry Lockhart</samp> but not <samp>Harry Potter/Gilderoy Lockhart</samp>.</dd>
  
  <dt>-: NOT </dt>
  <dd><kbd>Harry -Lockhart</kbd> will find <samp>Harry Potter</samp> but not <samp>Harry Lockhart</samp> or <samp>Gilderoy Lockhart/Harry Potter</samp>.</dd>
</dl>
