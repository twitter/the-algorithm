<h4>Bookmark Search: Date Bookmarked</h4>

<p>Specify a range of times to find bookmarks which were created during that time frame. This may differ from the time when the bookmarked item was posted or updated.</p>

<p>You can search by year, month, week, day, or hour.<p>

<h5>Examples:</h5>

<dl>
  <dt>&lt; 3 days ago</dt>
  <dd>will find bookmarks that were created within the past three days</dd>
  <dt>&gt; 3 years ago</dt>
  <dd>will find bookmarks that were created more than three years ago</dd>
  <dt>3-9 months ago</dt>
  <dd>will find bookmarks that were created between 3 and 9 months ago</dd>
</dl>

<p>The "ago" is optional. Note that "1 day ago" is not a range, and would only find bookmarks created at this exact instant yesterday. Create a range instead.</p>
