  <dt>Turn on History</dt>
  <dd>When enabled, History keeps a log of every work you access on the Archive while logged in. You can delete individual works from your History or clear the whole History. If you enable this option and subsequently disable it, works accessed while the option was enabled will still be saved (but you will have to enable History again to see them).</dd>
  
  <dt>Turn the new user help banner back on</dt>
  <dd>Enabling this option will turn on the banner offering information and hints on getting started with the Archive!</dd>
  
  <dt>Turn off the banner showing on every page</dt>
  <dd>Occasionally, Archive staff may notify users of important events or site changes by displaying a banner across all pages on the site. If you want to dismiss the banner while you're logged in, enable this option. Please note that this only hides the banner which was displaying at the time you enabled this option. If the banner is changed, the new banner will be displayed until you enable this option again. </dd>
