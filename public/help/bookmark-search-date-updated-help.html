<h4>Bookmark Search: Date Updated</h4>

<p>Specify a range of times to find bookmarked items that were posted or updated during that time frame: works with new chapters, for example, or series with new works. If a work was backdated by its creator (i.e. had a different publication date set when it was uploaded to the Archive), that date will be used for this search.</p>

<p>You can search by year, month, week, day, or hour.<p>

<h5>Examples:</h5>

<dl>
  <dt>&lt; 3 days ago</dt>
  <dd>will find bookmarks of works that were posted or updated within the past three days</dd>
  <dt>&gt; 3 years ago</dt>
  <dd>will find bookmarks of works that were posted or updated more than three years ago</dd>
  <dt>3-9 months ago</dt>
  <dd>will find bookmarks of works that were posted or updated between 3 and 9 months ago</dd>
</dl>

<p>The "ago" is optional. Note that "1 day ago" is not a range, and would only find items updated at this exact instant yesterday. Create a range instead.</p>
