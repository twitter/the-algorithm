# Snow Overview

The Archive briefly used pale lavender for its background color and several
other accents. Snow is a legacy skin created to turn those things pure white.

Because some of the elements that Snow turns pure white were changed to pale
grey in the default skin, it is necessary to keep using Snow as a parent for
Snow Blue.
