# Reporting a security issue

Please email us directly at [otw-coders@transformativeworks.org](mailto:otw-coders@transformativeworks.org)
with details and reproduction steps. We will get back to you as soon as possible,
and we may ask for additional information or guidance.

Please avoid testing for security issues on the Archive of Our Own itself,
as you risk disrupting other users and violating the [Terms of Service](https://archiveofourown.org/tos#IV.C.).

Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before any
disclosure to the public or a third-party.

We thank you for your effort and responsible disclosure! We will make sure you
receive due credit on [our public release notes](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts?tag=1).
