# Topic Social Proof Service (TSPS)
=================

**Topic Social Proof Service** (TSPS) serves as a centralized source for verifying topics related to Timelines and Notifications. By analyzing user's topic preferences, such as following or unfollowing, and employing semantic annotations and tweet embeddings from SimClusters, or other machine learning models, TSPS delivers highly relevant topics tailored to each user's interests.

For instance, when a tweet discusses Stephen Curry, the service determines if the content falls under topics like "NBA" and/or "Golden State Warriors" while also providing relevance scores based on SimClusters Embedding. Additionally, TSPS evaluates user-specific topic preferences to offer a comprehensive list of available topics, only those the user is currently following, or new topics they have not followed but may find interesting if recommended on specific product surfaces.
