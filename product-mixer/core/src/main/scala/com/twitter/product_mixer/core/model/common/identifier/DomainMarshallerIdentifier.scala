   *       - Inability to mutate the field object instance itself (i.e. each field is an immutable
   *       data structure), assuming stable hashCode implementations for these objects
   *
   * @note In order for the hashCode to be consistent with object equality, `##` must be used for
   *       boxed numeric types and null. As such, always prefer `.##` over `.hashCode()`.
