/**
 * Hydrate features about the query itself (not about the candidates)

 *
 * @note [[BaseQueryFeatureHydrator]]s populate [[Feature]]s with last-write-wins semantics for
 *       duplicate [[Feature]]s, where the last hydrator to run that populates a [[Feature]] will
 *       override any previously run [[BaseQueryFeatureHydrator]]s values for that [[Feature]].
 *       In a [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineConfig PipelineConfig]] this means
 *       that the right-most [[BaseQueryFeatureHydrator]] to populate a given [[Feature]] will be
 *       the value that is available to use.
 *
 * @note if you want to conditionally run a [[BaseQueryFeatureHydrator]] you can use the mixin [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.model.common.Conditionally]]
 *       or to gate on a [[com.twitter.timelines.configapi.Param]] you can use [[com.twitter.product_mixer.component_library.feature_hydrator.query.param_gated.ParamGatedQueryFeatureHydrator]]
 *
 * @note Any exceptions that are thrown or returned as [[Stitch.exception]] will be added to the
 *       [[FeatureMap]] for the [[Feature]]s that were supposed to be hydrated.
 *       Accessing a failed Feature will throw if using [[FeatureMap.get]] for Features that aren't

 *
 * When `hydrateBefore` is reached, any duplicate [[Feature]]s that were already hydrated will be
 * overridden with the new value from the [[AsyncHydrator]]
 *
 * @note [[AsyncHydrator]]s have the same last-write-wins semantics for duplicate [[Feature]]s
 *       as [[BaseQueryFeatureHydrator]] but with some nuance. If [[AsyncHydrator]]s for the
 *       same [[Feature]] have the same `hydrateBefore` then the right-most [[AsyncHydrator]]s
 *       value takes precedence. Similarly, [[AsyncHydrator]]s always hydrate after any other
 *       [[BaseQueryFeatureHydrator]]. See the examples for more detail.
 * @example if [[QueryFeatureHydrator]]s that populate the same [[Feature]] are defined in a `PipelineConfig`
 *          such as `[ asyncHydratorForFeatureA, normalHydratorForFeatureA ]`, where `asyncHydratorForFeatureA`
 *          is an [[AsyncHydrator]], when `asyncHydratorForFeatureA` reaches it's `hydrateBefore`
 *          Step in the Pipeline, the value for `FeatureA` from the `asyncHydratorForFeatureA` will override
 *          the existing value from `normalHydratorForFeatureA`, even though in the initial `PipelineConfig`
 *          they are ordered differently.
 * @example if [[AsyncHydrator]]s that populate the same [[Feature]] are defined in a `PipelineConfig`
 *          such as `[ asyncHydratorForFeatureA1, asyncHydratorForFeatureA2 ]`, where both [[AsyncHydrator]]s
 *          have the same `hydrateBefore`, when `hydrateBefore` is reached, the value for `FeatureA` from
 *          `asyncHydratorForFeatureA2` will override the value from `asyncHydratorForFeatureA1`.
