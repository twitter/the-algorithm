   * dependency ([[PipelineQuery]] depends on [[FeatureMap]], and the methods below depend on
   * [[PipelineQuery]])
   *
   * @param featureMap the featureMap we are wrapping
   * @note The FeatureStoreV1Feature::defaultValue set on the BoundFeature is only used and set
   *       during PredictionRecord to DataRecord conversion. Therefore, the default will not be set
   *       on the PredictionRecord value if reading from it directly, and as such for convenience
   *       the defaultValue is manually returned during retrieval from PredictionRecord.
   * @note the Value generic type on the methods below cannot be passed to
   *       FeatureStoreV1QueryFeature's Value generic type. While this is actually the same type,
   *       (note the explicit type cast back to Value), we must instead use an existential on
   *       FeatureStoreV1QueryFeature since it is constructed with an existential for the Value
   *       generic (see [[FeatureStoreV1QueryFeature]] and [[FeatureStoreV1CandidateFeature]])
