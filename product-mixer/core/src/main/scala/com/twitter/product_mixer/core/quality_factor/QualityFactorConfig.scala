/**

 * latencies), the quality factor should go down, which helps future calls to ease their demand/load (such as
 * reducing request width); if ops/calls are fast, the quality factor should go up, so we can incur more load.

/**
 * This is a linear quality factor implementation, aimed to achieve and maintain a percentile latency target.
 *
 * If we call quality factor q, target latency t and target percentile p,
 *   then the q (quality factor) formula should be:
 *   q += delta                      for each request with latency <= t
 *   q -= delta * p / (100 - p)      for each request with latency > t ms or a timeout.
 *
 *   When percentile p latency stays at target latency t, then based on the formula above, q will
 *   stay constant (fluctuates around a constant value).
 *
 *   For example, assume t = 100ms, p = p99, and q = 0.5
 *   let's say, p99 latency stays at 100ms when q = 0.5. p99 means that out of every 100 latencies,
 *   99 times the latency is below 100ms and 1 time it is above 100ms. So based on the formula above,
 *   q will increase by "delta" 99 times and it will decrease by delta * p / (100 - p) = delta * 99 once,
 *   which results in the same q = 0.5.
 *
 * @param targetLatency This is the latency target, calls with latencies above which will cause quality
 * factor to go down, and vice versa. e.g. 500ms.
 * @param targetLatencyPercentile This the percentile where the target latency is aimed at. e.g. 95.0.
 * @param delta the step for adjusting quality factor. It should be a positive double. If delta is
 *              too large, then quality factor will fluctuate more, and if it is too small, the
 *              responsiveness will be reduced.

/**
 * A quality factor provides component capacity state based on sampling component
 * Queries Per Second (qps) at local host level.
 *
 * If we call quality factor q, max qps R:
 *   then the q (quality factor) formula should be:
 *   q = Math.min([[qualityFactorBounds.bounds.maxInclusive]], q + delta)      for each request that observed qps <= R on local host
 *   q -= delta                                      for each request that observed qps > R on local host
 *
 *   When qps r stays below R, q will stay as constant (value at [[qualityFactorBounds.bounds.maxInclusive]]).
 *   When qps r starts to increase above R, q will decrease by delta per request,
 *   with delta being an additive factor that controls how sensitive q is when max qps R is exceeded.
 *
 *   @param initialDelay Specifies an initial delay time to allow query rate counter warm up to start reflecting actual traffic load.
 *                       Qf value would only start to update after this initial delay.
 *   @param maxQueriesPerSecond The max qps the underlying component can take. Requests go above this qps threshold will cause quality factor to go down.
 *   @param queriesPerSecondSampleWindow The window of underlying query rate counter counting with and calculate an average qps over the window,
 *                                 default to count with 10 seconds time window (i.e. qps = total requests over last 10 secs / 10).
 *                                 Note: underlying query rate counter has a sliding window with 10 fixed slices. Therefore a larger
 *                                 window would lead to a coarser qps calculation. (e.g. with 60 secs time window, it sliding over 6 seconds slice (60 / 10 = 6 secs)).
 *                                 A larger time window also lead to a slower reaction to sudden qps burst, but more robust to flaky qps pattern.
 *   @param delta The step for adjusting quality factor. It should be a positive double. If the delta is large, the quality factor
 *                will fluctuate more and be more responsive to exceeding max qps, and if it is small, the quality factor will be less responsive.
