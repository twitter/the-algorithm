/**
 * A [[Feature]] is a single measurable or computable property of an entity.
 *
 * @note If a [[Feature]] is optional then the [[Value]] should be `Option[Value]`
 *
 * @note If a [[Feature]] is populated with a [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator.FeatureHydrator]]
 *       and the hydration fails, a failure will be stored for the [[Feature]].
 *       If that [[Feature]] is accessed with [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap.get]]
 *       then the stored exception will be thrown, essentially failing-closed.
 *       You can use [[FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure]] or [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap.getOrElse]]
 *       instead to avoid these issues and instead fail-open.
 *       If correctly hydrating a Feature's value is essential to the request being correct,
 *       then you should fail-closed on failure to hydrate it by extending [[Feature]] directly.
 *
 *       This does not apply to [[Feature]]s from [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.transformer.FeatureTransformer]]
 *       which throw in the calling Pipeline instead of storing their failures.
 *
 * @tparam Entity The type of entity that this feature works with. This could be a User, Tweet,
 *                Query, etc.
 * @tparam Value The type of the value of this feature.

/**
 * With a [[Feature]], if the [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.feature_hydrator.FeatureHydrator]] fails,
 * the failure will be caught by the platform and stored in the [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap]].
 * Accessing a failed feature via [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap.get()]]
 * will throw the exception that was caught while attempting to hydrate the feature. If there's a
 * reasonable default for a [[Feature]] to fail-open with, then throwing the exception at read time
 * can be prevented by defining a `defaultValue` via [[FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure]]. When accessing
 * a failed feature via [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap.get()]]
 * for a [[FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure]], the `defaultValue` will be returned.
 *
 *
 * @note [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap.getOrElse()]] can also be used
 *       to access a failed feature without throwing the exception, by defining the default via the
 *       [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.feature.featuremap.FeatureMap.getOrElse()]] method call
 *       instead of as part of the feature declaration.
 * @note This does not apply to [[FeatureWithDefaultOnFailure]]s from [[com.twitter.product_mixer.core.functional_component.transformer.FeatureTransformer]]
 *       which throw in the calling Pipeline instead of storing their failures.
 *
 * @tparam Entity The type of entity that this feature works with. This could be a User, Tweet,
