package com.X.product_mixer.core.quality_factor

/**
 * [[QualityFactor]] is an abstract number that enables a feedback loop to control operation costs and ultimately
 * maintain the operation success rate. Abstractly, if operations/calls are too expensive (such as high
 * latencies), the quality factor should go down, which helps future calls to ease their demand/load (such as
 * reducing request width); if ops/calls are fast, the quality factor should go up, so we can incur more load.
 *
 * @note to avoid overhead the underlying state may sometimes not be synchronized.
 *       If a part of an application is unhealthy, it will likely be unhealthy for all threads,
 *       it will eventually result in a close-enough quality factor value for all thread's view of the state.
 *
 *       In extremely low volume scenarios such as manual testing in a development environment,
 *       it's possible that different threads will have vastly different views of the underling state,
 *       but in practice, in production systems, they will be close-enough.
