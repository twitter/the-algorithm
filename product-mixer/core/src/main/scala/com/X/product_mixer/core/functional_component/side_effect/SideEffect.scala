/**
 * A side-effect is a ancillary action that doesn't affect the result of execution directly.
 *
 * For example: Logging, history stores
 *
 * Implementing components can express failures by throwing an exception. These exceptions
 * will be caught and not affect the request processing.
 *
 * @note Side effects execute asynchronously in a fire-and-forget way, it's important to add alerts
 *       to the [[SideEffect]] component itself since a failures wont show up in metrics
 *       that just monitor your pipeline as a whole.
 *
 * @see [[ExecuteSynchronously]] for modifying a [[SideEffect]] to execute with synchronously with
 *      the request waiting on the side effect to complete, this will impact the overall request's latency
