/**
 * An internal representation of an async [[FeatureMap]] containing [[Stitch]]s of [[FeatureMap]]s
 * which are already running in the background.
 *
 * Async features are added by providing the [[PipelineStepIdentifier]] of the [[com.X.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineBuilder.Step Step]]
 * before which the async [[Feature]]s are needed, and a [[Stitch]] of the async [[FeatureMap]].
 * It's expected that the [[Stitch]] has already been started and is running in the background.
 *
 * While not essential to it's core behavior, [[AsyncFeatureMap]] also keeps track of the [[FeatureHydratorIdentifier]]
 * and the Set of [[Feature]]s which will be hydrated for each [[Stitch]] of a [[FeatureMap]] it's given.
 *
 * @param asyncFeatureMaps the [[FeatureMap]]s for [[PipelineStepIdentifier]]s which have not been reached yet
 *
 * @note [[PipelineStepIdentifier]]s must only refer to [[com.X.product_mixer.core.pipeline.PipelineBuilder.Step Step]]s
 *       in the current [[com.X.product_mixer.core.pipeline.Pipeline Pipeline]].
 *       Only plain [[FeatureMap]]s are passed into underlying [[com.X.product_mixer.core.model.common.Component Component]]s and
 *       [[com.X.product_mixer.core.pipeline.Pipeline Pipeline]]s so [[AsyncFeatureMap]]s are scoped
 *       for a specific [[com.X.product_mixer.core.pipeline.Pipeline Pipeline]] only.
