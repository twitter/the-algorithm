/**
 * Select all candidates from candidate pipeline(s) and append to the end of the result.
 *
 * @note that if multiple candidate pipelines are specified, their candidates will be added
 *       to the result in the order in which they appear in the candidate pool. This ordering often
 *       reflects the order in which the candidate pipelines were listed in the mixer/recommendations
 *       pipeline, unless for example an UpdateSortCandidates selector was run prior to running
 *       this selector which could change this ordering.
 *
 * @note if inserting results from multiple candidate pipelines (see note above related to ordering),
 *       it is more performant to include all (or a subset) of the candidate pipelines in a single
 *       InsertAppendResults, as opposed to calling InsertAppendResults individually for each
 *       candidate pipeline because each selector does an O(n) pass on the candidate pool.
