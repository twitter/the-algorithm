# Contributing to OTW-Archive

## Reporting bugs

We maintain a [Jira issue tracker](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net) for developers,
and a [list of Known Issues](https://archiveofourown.org/known_issues) for
[Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org) users, neither of which are
publicly editable.

If you need help using the site, or want to report an issue you have found,
please [contact the AO3 Support team](https://archiveofourown.org/support).


## Reporting security issues

Please refer to [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/blob/master/SECURITY.md).


## Updating documentation

Our [development wiki](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki) is publicly
editable. Unless a page says at the top that it should only be edited by
official OTW volunteers, please feel free to make changes!


## Suggesting new features

Please [contact the AO3 Support team](https://archiveofourown.org/support).


## Contributing code

**We only accept pull requests for issues we have already added to [Jira](https://otwarchive.atlassian.net)**,
with the exception of spelling corrections and documentation improvements
(e.g. any Markdown files). 

If you'd like the ability to comment on, assign, and transition issues, 
you're welcome to create a Jira account! (It makes things a bit easier for us
on the organizational side if the Full Name on your Jira account either closely
matches the name you'd like us to credit in the release notes or includes it in
parentheses, e.g. "Nickname (CREDIT NAME).") We'll give you permissions when
you create your first pull request.

Please check out our development wiki for more information on:

- [how to set up a development environment](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki)
- [code conventions](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki/Commit-policy)

Please follow the checklist on [our template](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when submitting pull requests.

Please be patient with us! Due to our workload, it may take some time before we
can review and eventually merge your pull request.

Once your pull request is merged, it will be deployed to our internal testing site
and our QA team will check that everything is working as intended. If not, we may
set the issue to ["Broken on Test"](https://github.com/otwcode/otwarchive/wiki/Issue-Tracking-with-Jira)
and ask you to make further changes in new pull requests.

If all is well, your contribution will be deployed to the [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org)
and you will be credited in the [release notes](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts?tag=1)!
