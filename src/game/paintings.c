/**
 * @file paintings.c
 *
 * Implements the rippling painting effect. Paintings are GraphNodes that exist without being connected
 * to any particular object.
 *
 * Paintings are defined in level data. Look at levels/castle_inside/painting.inc.c for examples.
 *
 * The ripple effect uses data that is split into several parts:
 *      The mesh positions are generated from a base mesh. See seg2_painting_triangle_mesh near the
 *          bottom of bin/segment2.c
 *
 *      The lighting for the ripple is also generated from a base table, seg2_painting_mesh_neighbor_tris
 *          in bin/segment2.c
 *
 *      Each painting's texture uses yet another table to map its texture to the mesh.
 *          These maps are in level data, see levels/castle_inside/painting.inc.c for example.
 *
 *      Finally, each painting has two display lists, normal and rippling, which are defined in the same
 *      level data file as the Painting itself. See levels/castle_inside/painting.inc.c.
 *
 *
 * Painting state machine:
 * Paintings spawn in the PAINTING_IDLE state
 *      From IDLE, paintings can change to PAINTING_RIPPLE or PAINTING_ENTERED
 *        - This state checks for ENTERED because if mario waits long enough, a PROXIMITY painting could
 *          reset to IDLE
 *
 * Paintings in the PAINTING_RIPPLE state are passively rippling.
 *      For RIPPLE_TRIGGER_PROXIMITY paintings, this means mario bumped the wall in front of the
 *          painting.
 *
 *      Paintings that use RIPPLE_TRIGGER_CONTINUOUS try to transition to this state as soon as possible,
 *          usually when mario enters the room.
 *
 *      A PROXIMITY painting will automatically reset to IDLE if its ripple magnitude becomes small
 *          enough.
 *
 * Paintings in the PAINTING_ENTERED state have been entered by mario.
 *      A CONTINUOUS painting will automatically reset to RIPPLE if its ripple magnitude becomes small
 *          enough.
