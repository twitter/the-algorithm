# eawwybiwd wight wankew

*note: t-the wight wankew i-is an owd pawt o-of the stack which w-we awe cuwwentwy i-in the pwocess o-of wepwacing. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡
t-the cuwwent modew w-was wast twained sevewaw yeaws ago, -.- and uses some vewy stwange featuwes. :3
we awe w-wowking on twaining a nyew modew, ʘwʘ and eventuawwy w-webuiwding this pawt of the s-stack entiwewy.*

the eawwybiwd wight wankew is a wogistic wegwession m-modew which pwedicts the wikewihood t-that the u-usew wiww engage with a
tweet. 🥺
it is intended to be a simpwified vewsion of the h-heavy wankew which can wun on a gweatew amount of tweets. >_<

thewe awe cuwwentwy 2 m-main wight wankew modews in u-use: one fow wanking i-in nyetwowk t-tweets (`wecap_eawwybiwd`), ʘwʘ a-and
anothew fow
out of nyetwowk (uteg) t-tweets (`wectweet_eawwybiwd`). (˘ω˘) both modews awe twained using t-the `twain.py` scwipt which is
incwuded in this diwectowy. (✿oωo) they diffew mainwy in the set of featuwes
u-used by the modew. (///ˬ///✿)
the in n-nyetwowk modew uses
t-the `swc/python/twittew/deepbiwd/pwojects/timewines/configs/wecap/featuwe_config.py` f-fiwe to define the
featuwe configuwation, rawr x3 whiwe the
out o-of nyetwowk modew u-uses `swc/python/twittew/deepbiwd/pwojects/timewines/configs/wectweet_eawwybiwd/featuwe_config.py`. -.-

the `twain.py` s-scwipt is e-essentiawwy a sewies of hooks pwovided t-to fow twittew's `twmw` fwamewowk to exekawaii~, ^^
w-which is incwuded undew `twmw/`. (⑅˘꒳˘)

### featuwes

the wight w-wankew featuwes pipewine is as f-fowwows:
![eawwybiwd_featuwes.png](eawwybiwd_featuwes.png)

some o-of these components a-awe expwained bewow:

- index ingestew: an indexing pipewine that handwes the tweets as they awe genewated. nyaa~~ t-this is the main i-input of
  eawwybiwd, /(^•ω•^) it pwoduces t-tweet data (the b-basic infowmation a-about the tweet, (U ﹏ U) the text, 😳😳😳 the uwws, media entities, >w< facets, XD
  e-etc) and static featuwes (the featuwes you can compute diwectwy fwom a tweet w-wight nyow, o.O wike whethew it h-has uww, mya has
  cawds, h-has quotes, 🥺 e-etc); aww infowmation computed h-hewe awe stowed i-in index and fwushed a-as each weawtime i-index segments
  become fuww. ^^;; they awe woaded b-back watew f-fwom disk when eawwybiwd w-westawts. :3 n-nyote that the f-featuwes may be computed in a
  nyon-twiviaw way (wike deciding t-the vawue of hasuww), (U ﹏ U) they couwd be computed and combined fwom some mowe "waw"
  infowmation in t-the tweet and fwom othew sewvices. OwO
  signaw ingestew: the ingestew f-fow weawtime f-featuwes, 😳😳😳 pew-tweet f-featuwes that can change aftew t-the tweet has been
  indexed, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ m-mostwy sociaw e-engagements wike wetweetcount, XD favcount, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ wepwycount, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) etc, awong with some (futuwe) spam signaws
  t-that's computed with watew activities. rawr x3 t-these wewe cowwected and c-computed in a h-hewon topowogy by pwocessing muwtipwe
  event stweams a-and can be e-extended to suppowt mowe featuwes. nyaa~~
- u-usew tabwe f-featuwes is anothew set of featuwes pew usew. >_< they awe fwom usew tabwe updatew, a-a diffewent input t-that
  pwocesses a-a stweam wwitten by ouw usew s-sewvice. ^^;; it's u-used to stowe spawse weawtime usew
  i-infowmation. (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ these pew-usew featuwes awe pwopagated to the tweet being scowed b-by
  wooking u-up the authow of the tweet. ^^;;
- seawch context featuwes a-awe basicawwy t-the infowmation of cuwwent seawchew, (⑅˘꒳˘) wike theiw ui wanguage, rawr x3 t-theiw own
  pwoduced/consumed wanguage, (///ˬ///✿) and the cuwwent time (impwied). 🥺 they awe combined with t-tweet data to compute some of the
  featuwes used i-in scowing. >_<

the s-scowing function in eawwybiwd uses both static and weawtime featuwes. UwU e-exampwes o-of static featuwes used awe:

- whethew the tweet is a wetweet
- w-whethew the tweet contains a w-wink
- whethew this tweet has any twend wowds at ingestion time
- w-whethew the tweet is a wepwy
- a-a scowe fow the s-static quawity of the text, >_< computed i-in tweettextscowew.java in t-the ingestew. -.- based o-on the factows
  s-such as offensiveness, mya content e-entwopy, "shout" s-scowe, >w< wength, and weadabiwity. (U ﹏ U)
- tweepcwed, 😳😳😳 s-see top-wevew w-weadme.md

exampwes o-of weawtime featuwes used awe:

- numbew of t-tweet wikes/wepwies/wetweets
- ptoxicity and pbwock s-scowes pwovided b-by heawth modews
