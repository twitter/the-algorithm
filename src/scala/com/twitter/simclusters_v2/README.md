# SimClusters: Community-based Representations for Heterogeneous Recommendations at Twitter

## Overview
SimClusters is as a general-purpose representation layer based on overlapping communities into which users as well as heterogeneous content can be captured as sparse, interpretable vectors to support a multitude of recommendation tasks.

We build our user and tweet SimClusters embeddings based on the inferred communities, and the representations power our personalized tweet recommendation via our online serving service SimClusters ANN.

## Brief introduction to Simclusters Algorithm

### Follow relationships as a bipartite graph
Follow relationships on Twitter are perhaps most naturally thought of as directed graph, where each node is a user and each edge represents a Follow. Edges are directed in that User 1 can follow User 2, User 2 can follow User 1 or both User 1 and User 2 can follow each other.

This directed graph can be also viewed as a bipartite graph, where nodes are grouped into two sets, Producers and Consumers. In this bipartite graph, Producers are the users who are Followed and Consumers are the Followees. Below is a toy example of a follow graph for four users:

### Community Detection - Known For 
The bipartite follow graph can be used to identify groups of Producers who have similar followers, or who are "Known For" a topic. Specifically, the bipartite follow graph can also be represented as an *m x n* matrix (*A*), where consumers are presented as *u* and producers are represented as *v*.

Producer-producer similarity is computed as the cosine similarity between users who follow each producer. The resulting cosine similarity values can be used to construct a producer-producer similarity graph, where the nodes are producers and edges are weighted by the corresponding cosine similarity value. Noise removal is performed, such that edges with weights below a specified threshold are deleted from the graph.

After noise removal has been completed, Metropolis-Hastings sampling-based community detection is then run on the Producer-Producer similarity graph to identify a community affiliation for each producer. This algorithm takes in a parameter *k* for the number of communities to be detected.

> Figure 2 -  Left panel: Matrix representation of the follow graph depicted in Figure 1; Middle panel: Producer-Producer similarity is estimated by calculating the cosine similarity between the users who follow each producer; Right panel: Cosine similarity scores are used to create the Producer-Producer similarity graph. A clustering algorithm is run on the graph to identify groups of Producers with similar followers.

Community affiliation scores are then used to construct an *n x k* "Known For" matrix (*V*). This matrix is maximally sparse, and each Producer is affiliated with at most one community. In production, the Known For dataset covers the top 20M producers and k ~= 145000. In other words, we discover around 145k communities based on Twitter's user follow graph.

> Figure 3 -  The clustering algorithm returns community affiliation scores for each producer. These scores are represented in matrix V.

In the example above, Producer 1 is "Known For" community 2, Producer 2 is "Known For" community 1, and so forth.

### Consumer Embeddings - User InterestedIn
An Interested In matrix (*U*) can be computed by multiplying the matrix representation of the follow graph (*A*) by the Known For matrix (*V*):

In this toy example, consumer 1 is interested in community 1 only, whereas consumer 3 is interested in all three communities. There is also a noise removal step applied to the Interested In matrix.

We use the InterestedIn embeddings to capture consumer's long-term interest. The InterestedIn embeddings is one of our major source for consumer-based tweet recommendations.

### Producer Embeddings
When computing the Known For matrix, each producer can only be Known For a single community. Although this maximally sparse matrix is useful from a computational perspective, we know that our users tweet about many different topics and may be "Known" in many different communities. Producer embeddings ( *Ṽ* )  are used to capture this richer structure of the graph.

To calculate producer embeddings, the cosine similarity is calculated between each Producer’s follow graph and the Interested In vector for each community.

Producer embeddings are used for producer-based tweet recommendations. For example, we can recommend similar tweets based on an account you just followed.

### Entity Embeddings
SimClusters can also be used to generate embeddings for different kind of contents, such as
- Tweets (used for Tweet recommendations)
- Topics (used for TopicFollow)

#### Tweet embeddings
When a tweet is created, its tweet embedding is initialized as an empty vector.
Tweet embeddings are updated each time the tweet is favorited. Specifically, the InterestedIn vector of each user who Fav-ed the tweet is added to the tweet vector.
Since tweet embeddings are updated each time a tweet is favorited, they change over time.

Tweet embeddings are critical for our tweet recommendation tasks. We can calculate tweet similarity and recommend similar tweets to users based on their tweet engagement history.

We have an online Heron job that updates the tweet embeddings in realtime, check out [here](summingbird/README.md) for more. 

#### Topic embeddings
Topic embeddings (**R**) are determined by taking the cosine similarity between consumers who are interested in a community and the number of aggregated favorites each consumer has taken on a tweet that has a topic annotation (with some time decay).
