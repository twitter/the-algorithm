tweepcwed

tweepcwed is a sociaw n-nyetwowk anawysis t-toow that cawcuwates t-the infwuence o-of twittew u-usews based on theiw i-intewactions w-with othew usews. o.O t-the toow uses the pagewank awgowithm to wank usews based on theiw infwuence. ^^

p-pagewank awgowithm
pagewank is a gwaph awgowithm t-that was owiginawwy devewoped b-by googwe to detewmine the impowtance of web pages in seawch wesuwts. >_< t-the awgowithm wowks by assigning a-a nyumewicaw s-scowe to each page based on the nyumbew and quawity of othew pages that wink t-to it. >w< the mowe winks a page has fwom othew high-quawity pages, the highew its p-pagewank scowe. >_<

in the tweepcwed p-pwoject, >w< the p-pagewank awgowithm i-is used to detewmine t-the infwuence of twittew usews based on t-theiw intewactions with othew usews. rawr the gwaph is c-constwucted by tweating twittew usews as nyodes, rawr x3 and theiw intewactions (mentions, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) wetweets, etc.) as edges. (˘ω˘) the p-pagewank scowe of a usew wepwesents t-theiw infwuence i-in the nyetwowk. 😳

t-tweepcwed pagewank impwementation
the impwementation of t-the pagewank awgowithm i-in tweepcwed is based on t-the hadoop mapweduce f-fwamewowk. OwO the awgowithm is s-spwit into two stages: pwepawation a-and itewation. (˘ω˘)

the pwepawation stage invowves c-constwucting the gwaph of twittew u-usews and theiw intewactions, òωó a-and initiawizing e-each usew's pagewank scowe to a defauwt vawue. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) this stage is impwemented in the pwepawepagewankdata cwass. UwU

t-the itewation stage i-invowves wepeatedwy cawcuwating a-and updating t-the pagewank scowes o-of each usew untiw convewgence is weached. /(^•ω•^) this stage is impwemented i-in the updatepagewank cwass, (ꈍᴗꈍ) which is wun muwtipwe times untiw the awgowithm c-convewges. 😳

the tweepcwed p-pagewank impwementation a-awso incwudes a-a nyumbew of optimizations t-to impwove pewfowmance a-and weduce m-memowy usage. mya t-these optimizations incwude bwock compwession, mya w-wazy woading, /(^•ω•^) a-and in-memowy caching. ^^;;


========================================== t-tweepcwedbatchjob.scawa ==========================================


t-this is a-a scawa cwass that wepwesents a batch job fow computing the "tweepcwed" (twittew c-cwedibiwity) scowe fow twittew usews using weighted ow unweighted pagewank awgowithm. 🥺 the cwass e-extends the anawyticsitewativebatchjob cwass, ^^ which is pawt of the scawding fwamewowk u-used fow d-data pwocessing o-on hadoop. ^•ﻌ•^

the cwass defines vawious p-pwopewties and methods that a-awe used to configuwe a-and wun the batch job. /(^•ω•^) the awgs pawametew wepwesents the command-wine awguments that awe p-passed to the batch job, ^^ such a-as the --weighted fwag that detewmines w-whethew to u-use the weighted pagewank awgowithm ow nyot. 🥺

t-the wun method ovewwides t-the wun method of the base c-cwass and pwints t-the batch statistics aftew the job has finished. (U ᵕ U❁) the chiwdwen method defines a-a wist of chiwd j-jobs that nyeed t-to be exekawaii~d as pawt of the b-batch job. 😳😳😳 the m-messageheadew method wetuwns a s-stwing that wepwesents the headew of the batch job message. nyaa~~

========================================== extwacttweepcwed.scawa ==========================================

t-this c-cwass is a scawding job that cawcuwates "tweepcwed" fwom a given p-pagewank fiwe. (˘ω˘) t-tweepcwed is a measuwe of weputation fow twittew usews that takes i-into account the nyumbew of fowwowews they have and the nyumbew of peopwe they f-fowwow. if the optionaw awgument post_adjust is s-set to twue (defauwt v-vawue), >_< then the pagewank vawues awe adjusted based on the u-usew's fowwowew-to-fowwowing watio. XD

t-the cwass takes sevewaw command-wine awguments specifying i-input and output fiwes and options, rawr x3 a-and it uses the scawding wibwawy to pewfowm distwibuted data p-pwocessing on the input fiwes. ( ͡o ω ͡o ) i-it weads in the p-pagewank fiwe and a usew mass fiwe, :3 b-both in tsv fowmat, mya and combines t-them to pwoduce a-a nyew pagewank f-fiwe with the adjusted vawues. σωσ t-the adjusted p-pagewank is then used to cawcuwate tweepcwed vawues, (ꈍᴗꈍ) w-which awe w-wwitten to output f-fiwes. OwO

the code makes use of the mostwecentcombinedusewsnapshotsouwce c-cwass fwom the com.twittew.pwuck.souwce.combined_usew_souwce p-package to o-obtain usew infowmation fwom the usew mass fiwe. o.O it awso uses t-the weputation cwass t-to pewfowm t-the tweepcwed cawcuwations a-and adjustments. 😳😳😳


========================================== usewmass.scawa ==========================================

t-the usewmass cwass is a hewpew cwass used to cawcuwate the "mass" of a usew on twittew, /(^•ω•^) as defined b-by a cewtain awgowithm. OwO the m-mass scowe wepwesents the usew's w-weputation and is used in vawious a-appwications, ^^ such as in detewmining w-which u-usews shouwd be w-wecommended to f-fowwow ow which u-usews shouwd have theiw content highwighted. (///ˬ///✿)

the getusewmass method of the usewmass cwass takes in a combinedusew o-object, (///ˬ///✿) which c-contains infowmation a-about a twittew usew, (///ˬ///✿) and w-wetuwns an optionaw usewmassinfo object, ʘwʘ which contains the usew's i-id and cawcuwated m-mass scowe. ^•ﻌ•^

the awgowithm u-used to cawcuwate the mass scowe takes into account v-vawious factows s-such as the usew's account age, OwO n-nyumbew of fowwowews a-and fowwowings, (U ﹏ U) device usage, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ and safety status (westwicted, (⑅˘꒳˘) suspended, (U ﹏ U) v-vewified). the c-cawcuwation invowves a-adding and m-muwtipwying weight f-factows and adjusting the mass s-scowe based on a-a thweshowd fow the nyumbew of f-fwiends and fowwowews. o.O


========================================== p-pwepawepagewankdata.scawa ==========================================

the pwepawepagewankdata c-cwass pwepawes the gwaph data fow the page wank c-cawcuwation. mya it genewates the i-initiaw pagewank a-and then stawts the weightedpagewank j-job. XD it has the fowwowing functionawities:

i-it weads the usew m-mass tsv fiwe g-genewated by the twadoop usew_mass job. òωó
it weads the gwaph data, (˘ω˘) w-which is eithew a tsv fiwe ow a combination of f-fwock edges and w-weaw gwaph inputs fow weights. :3
i-it genewates the initiaw pagewank a-as the stawting p-point fow the pagewank computation. OwO
it wwites t-the nyumbew of nyodes to a tsv fiwe and dumps the n-nyodes to anothew t-tsv fiwe. mya
it has sevewaw options w-wike weighted, (˘ω˘) fwock_edges_onwy, o.O a-and input_pagewank t-to fine-tune t-the pagewank cawcuwation. (✿oωo)
it awso has options fow the weightedpagewank and extwacttweepcwed jobs, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ wike output_pagewank, ^^;; output_tweepcwed, OwO maxitewations, 🥺 jumppwob, mya thweshowd, 😳 and post_adjust. òωó
the pwepawepagewankdata cwass has sevewaw h-hewpew functions w-wike getfwockedges, /(^•ω•^) getweawgwaphedges, -.- getfwockweawgwaphedges, òωó a-and getcsvedges t-that wead the gwaph d-data fwom diffewent souwces w-wike daw, /(^•ω•^) intewactiongwaph, /(^•ω•^) ow csv f-fiwes. 😳 it awso h-has the genewateinitiawpagewank function that g-genewates the initiaw pagewank fwom t-the gwaph data. :3

========================================== w-weightedpagewank.scawa ==========================================

weightedpagewank is a cwass that p-pewfowms the w-weighted pagewank a-awgowithm on a-a given gwaph. (U ᵕ U❁)

t-the awgowithm stawts f-fwom a given p-pagewank vawue a-and pewfowms one i-itewation, ʘwʘ then tests fow convewgence. o.O i-if convewgence h-has nyot b-been weached, ʘwʘ the awgowithm cwones i-itsewf and stawts the nyext pagewank job with t-the updated pagewank as input. ^^ i-if convewgence h-has been weached, ^•ﻌ•^ t-the awgowithm stawts the extwacttweepcwed j-job instead. mya

the cwass t-takes in sevewaw options, UwU incwuding t-the wowking diwectowy, >_< totaw n-nyumbew of nyodes, /(^•ω•^) nyodes fiwe, òωó pagewank fiwe, σωσ totaw diffewence, ( ͡o ω ͡o ) whethew to p-pewfowm weighted pagewank, nyaa~~ the c-cuwwent itewation, :3 m-maximum itewations to wun, UwU pwobabiwity of a wandom jump, and w-whethew to do post adjust. o.O

the a-awgowithm weads a-a nyodes fiwe that i-incwudes the souwce nyode id, (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ destination nyode i-ids, ^^;; weights, a-and mass pwiow. ʘwʘ the awgowithm awso w-weads an input pagewank fiwe that incwudes the s-souwce nyode id and mass input. σωσ t-the awgowithm t-then pewfowms one i-itewation of the pagewank awgowithm a-and wwites t-the output pagewank t-to a fiwe. ^^;;

t-the awgowithm tests fow convewgence b-by cawcuwating t-the totaw diffewence b-between t-the input and o-output pagewank m-masses. ʘwʘ if convewgence h-has nyot b-been weached, the awgowithm cwones i-itsewf and stawts the next pagewank j-job. ^^ if convewgence has been w-weached, nyaa~~ the a-awgowithm stawts t-the extwacttweepcwed job. (///ˬ///✿)

========================================== weputation.scawa ==========================================

this is a hewpew c-cwass cawwed w-weputation that c-contains methods fow cawcuwating a usew's weputation scowe. XD the f-fiwst method c-cawwed scawedweputation takes a d-doubwe pawametew w-waw which wepwesents the usew's page wank, :3 and wetuwns a byte vawue t-that wepwesents t-the usew's w-weputation on a s-scawe of 0 to 100. òωó this method uses a fowmuwa that i-invowves convewting t-the wogawithm of the page wank to a nyumbew b-between 0 and 100. ^^

the second method cawwed a-adjustweputationspostcawcuwation takes thwee pawametews: m-mass (a d-doubwe vawue wepwesenting the usew's p-page wank), ^•ﻌ•^ n-nyumfowwowews (an int vawue wepwesenting t-the nyumbew of fowwowews a-a usew has), σωσ a-and nyumfowwowings (an i-int vawue w-wepwesenting the nyumbew of usews a-a usew is fowwowing). (ˆ ﻌ ˆ)♡ t-this method w-weduces the page wank of usews w-who have a wow nyumbew of fowwowews but a high n-nyumbew of fowwowings. nyaa~~ i-it cawcuwates a-a division factow based on the watio of fowwowings to fowwowews, ʘwʘ and weduces t-the usew's page wank by dividing i-it by this f-factow. ^•ﻌ•^ the method wetuwns the adjusted page wank. rawr x3
