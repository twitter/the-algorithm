TFG stands for Topic Follow Graph
The TFG topic embeddings are embeddings built from Topic Follow Graph.
Each topic is represented by the sum of its followers' user InterestedIn embeddings.

There are two types of embeddings:
logfav - topic embeddings built from followers' logfav-based InterestedIn
fav - topic embeddings built from followers' fav-based InterestedIn
