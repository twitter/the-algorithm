# Scoring

This folder contains the sql files that we'll use for scoring the real graph edges in BQ. We have 4 steps that take place:
- check to make sure that our models are in place. the feature importance query should return 20 rows in total: 10 rows per model, 1 for each feature.
- follow graph feature generation. this is to ensure that we have features for all users regardless if they have had any recent activity.
- candidate generation. this query combines the candidates from the follow graph and the activity graph, and the features from both.
- scoring. this query scores with 2 of our prod models and saves the scores to a table, with an additional field that distinguishes if an edge in in/out of network.

## Instructions

For deploying the job, you would need to create a zip file, upload to packer, and then schedule it with aurora.

```
zip -jr real_graph_scoring src/scala/com/X/interaction_graph/bqe/scoring && \
packer add_version --cluster=atla cassowary real_graph_scoring real_graph_scoring.zip
aurora cron schedule atla/cassowary/prod/real_graph_scoring src/scala/com/X/interaction_graph/bqe/scoring/scoring.aurora && \
aurora cron start atla/cassowary/prod/real_graph_scoring
```

# candidates.sql

This BigQuery (BQ) query does the following:

1. Declares two variables, date_start and date_end, which are both of type DATE.
2. Sets the date_end variable to the maximum partition ID of the interaction_graph_labels_daily table, using the PARSE_DATE() function to convert the partition ID to a date format.
3. Sets the date_start variable to 30 days prior to the date_end variable, using the DATE_SUB() function.
4. Creates a new table called candidates in the realgraph dataset, partitioned by ds.
5. The query uses three common table expressions (T1, T2, and T3) to join data from two tables (interaction_graph_labels_daily and tweeting_follows) to generate a table containing candidate information and features.
6. The table T3 is the result of a full outer join between T1 and T2, grouping by source_id and destination_id, and aggregating values such as num_tweets, label_types, and the counts of different types of labels (e.g. num_follows, num_favorites, etc.).
7. The T4 table ranks each source_id by the number of num_days and num_tweets, and selects the top 2000 rows for each source_id.
8. Finally, the query selects all columns from the T4 table and appends the date_end variable as a new column named ds.

Overall, the query generates a table of candidates and their associated features for a particular date range, using data from two tables in the twttr-bq-cassowary-prod and twttr-recos-ml-prod datasets.

# follow_graph_features.sql

This BigQuery script creates a table twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.tweeting_follows that includes features for X user interactions, specifically tweet counts and follows.

First, it sets two variables date_latest_tweet and date_latest_follows to the most recent dates available in two separate tables: twttr-bq-tweetsource-pub-prod.user.public_tweets and twttr-recos-ml-prod.user_events.valid_user_follows, respectively.

Then, it creates the tweet_count and all_follows CTEs.

The tweet_count CTE counts the number of tweets made by each user within the last 3 days prior to date_latest_tweet.

The all_follows CTE retrieves all the follows from the valid_user_follows table that happened on date_latest_follows and left joins it with the tweet_count CTE. It also adds a row number that partitions by the source user ID and orders by the number of tweets in descending order. The final output is filtered to keep only the top 2000 follows per user based on the row number.

The final SELECT statement combines the all_follows CTE with the date_latest_tweet variable and inserts the results into the twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.tweeting_follows table partitioned by date.

# scoring.sql

This BQ code performs operations on a BigQuery table called twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.scores. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of what the code does:

Declare two variables, date_end and date_latest_follows, and set their values based on the latest partitions in the twttr-bq-cassowary-prod.user.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS and twttr-recos-ml-prod.user_events.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARTITIONS tables that correspond to specific tables, respectively. The PARSE_DATE() function is used to convert the partition IDs to date format.

Delete rows from the twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.scores table where the value of the ds column is equal to date_end.

Insert rows into the twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.scores table based on a query that generates predicted scores for pairs of user IDs using two machine learning models. Specifically, the query uses the ML.PREDICT() function to apply two machine learning models (twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.prod and twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.prod_explicit) to the twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.candidates table. The resulting predicted scores are joined with the twttr-recos-ml-prod.realgraph.tweeting_follows table, which contains information about the number of tweets made by users and their follow relationships, using a full outer join. The final result includes columns for the source ID, destination ID, predicted score (prob), explicit predicted score (prob_explicit), a binary variable indicating whether the destination ID is followed by the source ID (followed), and the value of date_end for the ds column. If there is no match in the predicted_scores table for a given pair of user IDs, the COALESCE() function is used to return the corresponding values from the tweeting_follows table, with default values of 0.0 for the predicted scores.
