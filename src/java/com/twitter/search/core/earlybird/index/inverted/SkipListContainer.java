/**
 * This is a skip list container implementation backed by {@link IntBlockPool}.
 *
 * Skip list is a data structure similar to linked list, but with a hierarchy of lists
 * each skipping over fewer elements, and the bottom hierarchy does NOT skip any elements.
 * @see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list">Skip List Wikipedia</a>
 *
 * This implementation is lock free and thread safe with ONE writer thread and MULTIPLE reader
 * threads.
 *
 * This implementation could contain one or more skip lists, and they are all backed by
 * the same {@link IntBlockPool}.
 *
 * Values are actually stored as integers; however search key is implemented as a generic type.
 * Inserts of values that already exist are stored as subsequent elements. This is used to support
 * positions and term frequency.
 *
 * Also reserve the integer after value to store next ordinal pointer information. We avoid storing
 * pointers to the next element in the tower by allocating them contiguously. To descend the tower,
 * we just increment the pointer.
 *
 * This skip list can also store positions as integers. It allocates them before it allocates the
 * value (the value is a doc ID if we are using positions). This means that we can access the
 * position by simply decrementing the value pointer.
 *
 * To understand how the skip list works, first understand how insert works, then the rest will be
 * more comprehendable.
 *
 * A skip list will be implemented in a circle linked way:
 *   - the list head node will have the sentinel value, which is the advisory greatest value
 *     provided by comparator.
 *   - Real first value will be pointed by the list head node.
 *   - Real last value will point to the list head.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   - Does NOT support negative value.
 *
 * Simple Viz:
 *
 * Empty list with max tower height 420. S = Sentinel value, I = Initial value.
 *    | s| 420| 420| 420| 420| 420| i| i| i| i| i| i| i| i| i| i|
 *
 * One possible situation after inserting 420, 420, 420.
 *    | s| 420| 420| 420| 420| 420| 420|420|420| 420| 420| 420| 420| 420| 420| 420|
