/**
 * Lock used to ensure that flushing does not occur concurrently with the gc_before_optimization
 * and post_optimization_rebuilds actions - see where we call the "lock" method of this class.
 *
 * Both coordinated actions include a full GC in them, for reasons described in that part
 * of the code. After the GC, they wait until indexing has caught up before rejoining the serverset.
 *
 * If we flush concurrently with these actions, we can pause indexing for a while and waiting
 * until we're caught up can take some time, which can affect the memory state negatively.
 * For example, the first GC (before optimization) we do so that we have a clean state of memory
 * before optimization.
 *
 * The other reason we lock before executing the actions is because if we have flushing that's
 * currently running, once it finishes, we will rejoin the serverset and that can be followed by
 * a stop-the-world GC from the actions, which will affect our success rate.
