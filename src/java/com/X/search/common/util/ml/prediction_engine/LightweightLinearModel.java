/**
 * Provides an interface to the weights associated to the features of a linear model trained
 * with Prediction Engine.
 *
 * This class is used along with ScoreAccumulator to efficiently score instances. It supports only
 * a limited set of features:
 *
 * - Only linear models are supported.
 * - Only binary and continuous features (i.e. it doesn't support discrete/categorical features).
 * - It supports the MDL discretizer (but not the one based on trees).
 * - It doesn't support feature crossings.
 *
 * Instances of this class should be created using only the load methods (loadFromHdfs and
 * loadFromLocalFile).
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 *
 * Use this class, and ScoreAccumulator, ONLY when runtime is a major concern. Otherwise, consider
 * using Prediction Engine as a library. Ideally, we should access directly the structures that
 * Prediction Engine creates when it loads a model, instead of parsing a text file with the
 * feature weights.
 *
 * The discretized feature bins created by MDL may be too fine to be displayed properly in the
 * parsed text file and there may be bins with the same min value. A binary search finding the
 * bin for a same feature value therefore may end up with different bins/scores in different runs,
 * producing unstable scores. See SEARCHQUAL-15957 for more detail.
