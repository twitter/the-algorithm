selected dates. We require one business day as a grace period for the approval
process before the ad can go live. To pay for your campaign, click the "pay"
button within the campaign dashboard on the link above.

Your credit card will not be charged until 12-24 hours prior to your ad going
live on reddit.

If you have any questions in regards to advertising on reddit, just reply to
this email. A reddit team member will get back to you as quickly as they're
