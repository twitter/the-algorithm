  /**
   * Create Annoy based typed index builder that serializes index to a directory (HDFS/Local file system).
   * It cannot be used in scalding as it leverage C/C++ jni bindings, whose build conflicts with version of some libs installed on hadoop.
   * You can use it on aurora or with IndexBuilding job which triggers scalding job but then streams data to aurora machine for building index.
   * @param dimension dimension of embedding
   * @param numOfTrees builds a forest of numOfTrees trees.
   *                   More trees gives higher precision when querying at the cost of increased memory and disk storage requirement at the build time.
   *                   At runtime the index will be memory mapped, so memory wont be an issue but disk storage would be needed.
   * @param metric     distance metric for nearest neighbour search
   * @param injection Injection to convert bytes to Id.
   * @tparam T Type of Id for embedding
   * @tparam D Typed Distance
   * @return Serializable AnnoyIndex
