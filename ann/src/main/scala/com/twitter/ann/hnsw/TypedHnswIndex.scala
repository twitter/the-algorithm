   * Creates in-memory HNSW based index which supports querying/addition/updates of the entity embeddings.

   *
   * @param dimension Dimension of the embedding to be indexed
   * @param metric Distance metric (InnerProduct/Cosine/L2)
   * @param efConstruction The parameter has the same meaning as ef, but controls the
   *                       index_time/index_accuracy ratio. Bigger ef_construction leads to longer
   *                       construction, but better index quality. At some point, increasing
   *                       ef_construction does not improve the quality of the index. One way to
   *                       check if the selection of ef_construction was ok is to measure a recall
   *                       for M nearest neighbour search when ef = ef_construction: if the recall is
   *                       lower than 0.9, than there is room for improvement.
   * @param maxM The number of bi-directional links created for every new element during construction.
   *             Reasonable range for M is 2-100. Higher M work better on datasets with high
   *             intrinsic dimensionality and/or high recall, while low M work better for datasets
   *             with low intrinsic dimensionality and/or low recalls. The parameter also determines
   *             the algorithm's memory consumption, bigger the param more the memory requirement.
   *             For high dimensional datasets (word embeddings, good face descriptors), higher M
   *             are required (e.g. M=48, 64) for optimal performance at high recall.
   *             The range M=12-48 is ok for the most of the use cases.
   * @param expectedElements Approximate number of elements to be indexed
   * @param readWriteFuturePool Future pool for performing read (query) and write operation (addition/updates).
