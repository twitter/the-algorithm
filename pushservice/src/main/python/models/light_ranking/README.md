# Notification Light Ranker Model

## Model Context
There are 4 major components of Twitter notifications recommendation system: 1) candidate generation 2) light ranking 3) heavy ranking & 4) quality control. This notification light ranker model bridges candidate generation and heavy ranking by pre-selecting highly-relevant candidates from the initial huge candidate pool. Itâ€™s a light-weight model to reduce system cost during heavy ranking without hurting user experience.
