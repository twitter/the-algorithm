# Graph Feature Service

Graph Feature Service (GFS) is a distributed system that can provide various graph features for given pairs of users. For instance, given source user A and candidate user C, GFS can answer questions like “how many of A’s followings have favorited C”, “how many of A’s followings are following C”, and “how much C is similar to the users that A has favorited“.
