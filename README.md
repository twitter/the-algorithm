The OTW-Archive software is an open-source web application intended for hosting archives of fanworks, including fanfic, fanart, and fan vids.

Its development is sponsored and managed by the [Organization for Transformative Works](https://www.transformativeworks.org/), a nonprofit organization by and for fans.

Release Status
---------
Development of the OTW-Archive software is an ongoing labor of love. You can see it in action on the [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/), aka AO3, a multifandom archive also run by the OTW.

You can find more information about the [history and future of the AO3 project on the OTW website](https://www.transformativeworks.org/archive_of_our_own/).

If you wish to use this software, SquidgeWorld has generously provided [setup notes](https://squidgeworld.org/works/34491).
